## How to perform security testing in CI/CD pipeline? ##
Performing security testing in a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is crucial to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities early in the software development lifecycle. Here's a high-level guide on how to integrate security testing into your CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Select the Right Tools:**
	1. Choose appropriate security testing tools for your pipeline. Common security testing tools include SAST (Static Application Security Testing), DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing), SCA (Software Composition Analysis), and IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing) tools.
2. **Automate Security Scans:**
	1. Integrate security scans directly into your CI/CD pipeline. Use plugins or scripts to automate security testing tools' execution as part of your build and deployment process.
3. **Source Code Analysis (SAST):**
	1. Use Static Application Security Testing tools to scan your source code for vulnerabilities, coding errors, and security weaknesses. These tools analyze the code without executing it.
4. **Dynamic Scanning (DAST):**
	1. Incorporate Dynamic Application Security Testing into your pipeline to assess your running application for vulnerabilities. DAST tools simulate attacks on your application during runtime.
5. **Dependency Scanning (SCA):**
	1. Perform Software Composition Analysis to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies. This is essential to prevent known vulnerabilities from being introduced through external code.
6. **Configuration Analysis:**
	1. Include configuration analysis tools to assess the security of your application's server configurations, databases, and other infrastructure components.
7. **Automated Penetration Testing (IAST):**
	1. If possible, incorporate Interactive Application Security Testing to perform automated penetration testing and identify vulnerabilities as they occur during testing or runtime.
8. **Continuous Monitoring:**
	1. Implement continuous security monitoring to detect anomalies and security incidents in your application and infrastructure.
9. **Set Policies and Thresholds:**
	1. Define security policies and thresholds that trigger alerts or fail the build when vulnerabilities exceed acceptable levels. This ensures that critical security issues are addressed promptly.
10. **Integrate Security into DevOps Workflow:**
	1. Promote a DevSecOps culture by involving security experts in the CI/CD pipeline, fostering collaboration between development, operations, and security teams.
11. **Feedback Loop:**
	1. Establish a feedback loop that communicates security findings to developers. Provide clear, actionable remediation guidance to address vulnerabilities.
12. **Regular Scans and Updates:**
	1. Schedule regular security scans and keep your security testing tools up to date to detect newly discovered vulnerabilities.
13. **Compliance and Reporting:**
	1. Generate comprehensive reports on security scan results for compliance purposes and for stakeholders' awareness.
14. **Manual Testing and Review:**
	1. While automation is crucial, also conduct periodic manual security testing, code reviews, and threat modeling to identify complex or subtle security issues that automated tools might miss.
15. **Elastic Scalability:**
	1. Design your security testing processes to scale elastically to handle variations in workloads and the growth of your application.
16. **Parallel Execution:**
	1. Run security tests in parallel with other stages of your CI/CD pipeline to minimize delays.
17. **Notification and Escalation:**
	1. Implement notification mechanisms to alert teams and management about critical security vulnerabilities or incidents.
	
By integrating security testing into your CI/CD pipeline, you can detect and address security issues early in the development process, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities reaching production environments and enhancing the overall security posture of your software.
