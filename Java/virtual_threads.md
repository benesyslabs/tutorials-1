# Virtual Threads #
## Teach me virtual threads in Java. ##
Virtual threads are a new feature introduced in Java 16 as part of Project Loom. They are a type of thread that is managed by the JVM, similar to green threads, but they are implemented using native operating system threads, allowing them to take advantage of hardware-level optimizations.

The main difference between virtual threads and traditional threads is that **virtual threads are lightweight, meaning they can be created and destroyed more quickly than traditional threads**. This makes them **ideal for scenarios where a large number of threads need to be created and managed efficiently**.

To create a virtual thread in Java, you can use the Thread.startVirtualThread() method. Here is an example:

		Thread virtualThread = Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
			// code to be executed in the virtual thread
		});

In this example, we create a new virtual thread by calling the `Thread.startVirtualThread()` method and passing in a lambda expression that contains the code to be executed in the thread.

Virtual threads are designed to **work seamlessly with existing Java concurrency APIs, such as CompletableFuture and ExecutorService**. For example, here is how you can use a virtual executor to run a task asynchronously:

		VirtualThreadExecutor executor = VirtualThreadExecutor.newSingleThreadExecutor();
		CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
			// code to be executed asynchronously in the virtual executor
		}, executor);
		
In this example, we create a new virtual executor using the `VirtualThreadExecutor.newSingleThreadExecutor()` method and then use it to execute a task asynchronously using the `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync()` method.

Overall, virtual threads provide a lightweight and efficient way to manage concurrency in Java applications, while still allowing developers to use familiar concurrency APIs. However, it's important to note that virtual threads are a new feature and may not be fully supported by all Java libraries and frameworks.

## What are the advantages of using virtual threads over traditional threads in Java? ##
1. Virtual threads offer several advantages over traditional threads in Java, including:
	1. **Lower memory overhead**: Traditional threads have a relatively high memory overhead, as **each thread requires its own stack and other data structures**. Virtual threads, on the other hand, are much lighter-weight, as **they share a single stack with other threads and use less memory overall**.
	2. **Faster thread creation and destruction**: Constructing and destroying **traditional threads can be relatively slow, as it requires the operating system to allocate and deallocate resources**. Virtual threads, on the other hand, can be created and destroyed **more quickly, as they are managed by the JVM and do not rely on the operating system**.
	3. **Higher concurrency**: Because virtual threads are lightweight and can be created and destroyed more quickly, they **can support a higher level of concurrency than traditional threads**. This makes them **ideal for use cases such as highly parallelized algorithms or highly concurrent network servers**.
	4. **Better performance**: **Virtual threads can be scheduled more efficiently than traditional threads, as the JVM has more control over the scheduling process**. This can lead to better overall performance and lower latency in applications.
	5. **Easier programming model**: Virtual threads **can be used with familiar Java concurrency APIs, such as CompletableFuture and ExecutorService, making them easier to use for developers who are already familiar with these APIs**. Additionally, **virtual threads are less prone to concurrency issues such as deadlock and livelock, as they do not rely on locks and other synchronization primitives in the same way that traditional threads do**.
2. Overall, **virtual threads offer a more efficient and scalable way to manage concurrency in Java applications, while still maintaining compatibility with existing Java concurrency APIs**.

## What are the disadvantages of using virtual threads over traditional threads in Java? ##
1. While virtual threads offer several advantages over traditional threads in Java, there are also some potential disadvantages to consider:
	1. **Compatibility issues**: Virtual threads are a relatively new feature in Java and may not be fully supported by all libraries and frameworks. This can make it more difficult to migrate existing code to use virtual threads, and may limit the availability of third-party tools and libraries.
	2. **Limited control over scheduling**: While virtual threads are more efficient than traditional threads in terms of scheduling, they also offer less fine-grained control over the scheduling process. This can make it more difficult to optimize performance for specific use cases or to tune the behavior of the application in response to changing conditions.
	3. **Increased complexity**: While virtual threads can make some aspects of concurrent programming easier, they can also introduce additional complexity in certain scenarios. For example, virtual threads are more prone to resource contention issues than traditional threads, which can require more careful management.
	4. **Higher CPU usage**: Virtual threads can consume more CPU resources than traditional threads, as they rely on polling and other CPU-intensive techniques to manage concurrency. This can lead to higher CPU usage and potentially reduced battery life in mobile devices or other low-power environments.
2. Overall, while virtual threads offer several advantages over traditional threads in Java, they may not be the best choice for every scenario. Developers should carefully consider the trade-offs and potential downsides before deciding to use virtual threads in their applications.

## How is the ForkJoinPool used to implement Virtual Threads? ##
The `ForkJoinPool` is a class in the Java standard library that provides an implementation of the `ExecutorService` interface. It is primarily designed to support the Fork/Join framework, which is a mechanism for parallelizing tasks that can be divided into smaller subtasks and then combined together.

In Java 7 and later versions, the concept of virtual threads, also known as fibers or lightweight threads, has been introduced. Virtual threads are user-space threads that are scheduled by the application rather than the operating system. They can be much lighter and more efficient compared to traditional operating system threads.

To implement virtual threads using the `ForkJoinPool`, you can take advantage of the `ManagedBlocker` interface. The `ManagedBlocker` interface is used to represent tasks that can potentially block and provides a way to integrate with the `ForkJoinPool` thread pool.

Here's a general outline of how the `ForkJoinPool` can be used to implement virtual threads:

1. Construct an instance of the ForkJoinPool class, specifying the desired parallelism level. For example:

		ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool(parallelism);

2. Implement the `ManagedBlocker` interface to define the virtual thread behavior. The `ManagedBlocker` interface has two methods: `isReleasable()` and `block()`. The `isReleasable()` method checks if the virtual thread is able to proceed without blocking, and the `block()` method blocks the virtual thread if it's not releasable. Implement these methods according to your requirements.
3. Submit tasks to the `ForkJoinPool` using the `submit()` method or other relevant methods. These tasks can be instances of classes that implement the `Runnable` or `Callable` interfaces.
4. In the tasks, when you encounter a point where the virtual thread might block, use the `ForkJoinPool.managedBlock()` method to handle the blocking behavior. This method takes an instance of the `ManagedBlocker` interface and ensures that it adheres to the virtual thread semantics. For example:

		pool.managedBlock(managedBlocker);

By utilizing the `ForkJoinPool` and the `ManagedBlocker` interface, you can create a pool of virtual threads that are scheduled by the `ForkJoinPool` rather than relying on the operating system's thread scheduler. This approach can provide improved scalability and performance for certain types of applications, especially those involving fine-grained parallelism and potentially blocking tasks.
