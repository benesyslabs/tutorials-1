# JavaScript Design #
## What are the internals of JavaScript? ##
JavaScript is a **high-level**, **dynamic**, **interpreted programming language** used to create **interactive web applications**. The **internal components of JavaScript** include:

1. **ECMAScript**: ECMAScript is **the standard on which JavaScript is based**. It **defines the core features of the language**, such as **syntax**, **types**, and **built-in objects**. The **latest version of ECMAScript is ES2022**.
2. **JavaScript Engine**: The JavaScript engine is **a program that executes JavaScript code**. It **includes a compiler, which translates JavaScript code into machine code that can be executed by the computer, and a runtime, which manages the execution of the code**.
3. **Memory Heap**: The memory heap is **a region of memory where objects are allocated during runtime**. **Objects are allocated when they are created and deallocated when they are no longer needed**.
4. **Call Stack**: The call stack is **a data structure that tracks the execution of functions in a program**. **When a function is called, a new frame is added to the call stack, and when the function returns, the frame is removed from the stack**.
5. **Event Loop**: The **event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous events, such as user input and network requests**. It **continuously checks for new events in the event queue and executes them when they are available**.
6. **Callback Queue**: The callback queue is **a queue that holds callback functions that are ready to be executed by the event loop**. **When an asynchronous operation completes, its callback function is added to the callback queue**.
7. **Web APIs**: Web APIs are **built-in JavaScript functions that allow JavaScript to interact with the browser environment**. Examples of Web APIs include the **Document Object Model (DOM)**, **which allows JavaScript to manipulate HTML and CSS**, and the **XMLHttpRequest API, which allows JavaScript to make HTTP requests**.

Understanding these internal components is essential for developing efficient and effective JavaScript code.

## What are the types of ECMAScript? ##
ECMAScript is the standardized scripting language that JavaScript is based on, and it has evolved over time with new features and capabilities added in each version. The following are the different versions of ECMAScript:

1. ES1 (1997): The first version of ECMAScript, which laid the foundation for the language.
2. ES2 (1998): This version introduced changes related to regular expressions, better error handling, and more.
3. ES3 (1999): This version introduced many new features, including try/catch blocks, regular expressions, and better string manipulation.
4. ES4 (abandoned): A planned update that was never released, due to disagreements within the standards committee.
5. ES5 (2009): This version introduced several new features, including strict mode, array manipulation methods, JSON support, and more.
6. ES6/ES2015 (2015): This was a significant update that introduced many new features, including arrow functions, template literals, classes, modules, and more.
7. ES2016 (ES7): This version introduced features such as the exponentiation operator, Array.prototype.includes, and more.
8. ES2017 (ES8): This version introduced features such as async/await, Object.values/Object.entries, and more.
9. ES2018 (ES9): This version introduced features such as Rest/Spread properties for objects, Promise.prototype.finally, and more.
10. ES2019 (ES10): This version introduced features such as Array.prototype.flat/flatMap, Object.fromEntries, optional catch binding, and more.
11. ES2020 (ES11): This version introduced features such as BigInt, Nullish Coalescing operator, Optional Chaining operator, and more.
12. ES2021 (ES12): This version introduced features such as String.prototype.replaceAll, Logical Assignment Operators, Promise.any, and more.

Each version of ECMAScript adds new features and capabilities to the language, making it more powerful and flexible for building modern web applications.

## What types are supported in ECMAScript? ##
ECMAScript supports several data types, which are used to represent different kinds of values in a program. The following are the data types supported in ECMAScript:

1. **Primitive data types**:
	a. **Number**: used to represent numeric values. It includes **integers**, **floating-point numbers**, and **NaN** (Not a Number).
	b. **String**: used to represent textual data. It **includes a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes**.
	c. **Boolean**: used to represent logical values, either **true** or **false**.
	d. **Null**: used to represent a **null** or **empty value**.
	e. **Undefined**: used to represent a **variable that has not been assigned a value**.
2. **Object data type**: used **to represent complex data structures**, such as **arrays**, **functions**, and **objects**. **Objects in ECMAScript are collections of key-value pairs, where the key is a string or symbol, and the value can be any data type**.
3. **Symbol data type**: used to create **unique identifiers for object properties**.
4. **BigInt data type**: used to **represent integers larger than the maximum value that can be represented by a number data type**. BigInts are **represented by appending "n" to the end of an integer literal**.

In ECMAScript, **variables are dynamically typed, which means that the same variable can hold different types of data at different times during runtime**. For **example, a variable can be assigned a number value initially, but later, it can be assigned a string value**. This **dynamic typing allows for greater flexibility but can also lead to errors if not used carefully**.

## How does the JavaScript engine work? ##
JavaScript engines are programs that execute JavaScript code. They are **responsible for converting JavaScript code into machine-readable code that can be executed by a computer's processor**. Here is a brief overview of how JavaScript engines work:

1. **Lexical Analysis**: When a JavaScript engine encounters a block of code, **it first performs lexical analysis, also known as tokenization**. In this process, the **engine breaks down the code into individual tokens such as keywords, operators, and identifiers**.
2. **Parsing**: Once the code is tokenized, the **engine parses it into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**. The **AST is a hierarchical representation of the code, which the engine uses to understand the structure of the code**.
3. **Compilation**: After the AST is created, the **engine compiles the code into bytecode or machine code**. **Bytecode is an intermediate representation of the code that is faster to execute than the original JavaScript code**. **Some engines, such as V8, also use Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles frequently executed code into machine code on-the-fly for even faster execution**.
4. **Execution**: Once the code is compiled, the **engine executes it by running through the bytecode or machine code**. During this process, the **engine uses a call stack to keep track of function calls and returns, and a heap to manage memory allocation**.

JavaScript engines are constantly evolving, and modern engines employ a variety of **optimization techniques to improve performance**, such as **inlining**, **caching**, and **lazy evaluation**. These **optimizations allow JavaScript code to be executed faster than ever before, making it a popular choice for web development and beyond**.

## What is in-lining in JavaScript? ##
In JavaScript, inlining refers to the **process of replacing a function call with the actual code of the function being called**. This can **improve the performance of the code because it eliminates the overhead of the function call itself**.

**Inlining is performed by the JavaScript engine during optimization**. **When the engine detects that a particular function is being called frequently, it may decide to inline the function's code at the call site**. This **can result in faster code execution because the engine does not have to jump to a different part of the code to execute the function, and it does not have to perform the bookkeeping associated with a function call**.

However, inlining can also have some **downsides**. For **example, inlining can result in larger code size, which can reduce the effectiveness of caching and increase memory usage**. Additionally, **inlining can make it more difficult to debug code, since the call stack may not reflect the actual function calls that are occurring**.

Overall, inlining can be an effective optimization technique in certain situations, but **it is not always the best choice**. **JavaScript engines use a variety of optimization strategies, including inlining, to improve code performance while balancing trade-offs such as code size and debuggability**.

## Give an example of JavaScript byte-code. ##
JavaScript engines use **bytecode as an intermediate representation of the code that can be executed by the machine's processor**. While the specific format of the bytecode may vary between engines, here is an example of what JavaScript bytecode might look like for the following simple function:

		function add(a, b) {
		  return a + b;
		}

In bytecode form, this function might look something like:

		0000 Lda 1          ; Load argument 1 (a)
		0001 Lda 2          ; Load argument 2 (b)
		0002 Add            ; Add a and b
		0003 Ret            ; Return the result

In this bytecode, the instructions are **represented by opcodes (such as Lda for "load argument" and `Add` for "add")**, and the **arguments to those opcodes are represented by numeric values** (such as 1 and 2 in this example).

**When the function is executed, the JavaScript engine would interpret this bytecode and perform the appropriate operations** to add the two arguments together and return the result.

Note that this **example bytecode is highly simplified and not representative of the actual bytecode produced by modern JavaScript engines, which may use more complex instructions and optimizations to improve performance**.

## How is caching used to optimize for performance? ##
Caching is a technique used in computer science **to improve performance by storing frequently used data in a fast-access location**. **In JavaScript, caching can be used to improve performance by reducing the amount of time it takes to access data that is used repeatedly**.

One **common use of caching in JavaScript is to cache the results of expensive operations**. For example, **if a function performs a complex calculation, the result of that calculation can be stored in a cache so that the next time the function is called with the same input, the cached result can be returned instead of recomputing the result from scratch**. This **can significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to execute the function and improve overall performance**.

**Caching can also be used to store frequently accessed data such as configuration settings, user preferences, or data retrieved from a server**. **By storing this data in a cache, it can be accessed more quickly than if it had to be retrieved from a slower data source such as a database or server**.

In JavaScript, **there are several types of caching that can be used to improve performance, including browser caching, HTTP caching, and client-side caching**. **Browser caching involves storing frequently accessed files such as images, scripts, and stylesheets in the user's browser cache, so they can be loaded more quickly on subsequent visits to the site**. **HTTP caching involves adding cache headers to HTTP responses to allow the client (such as a browser) to cache the response for a specified period of time**. **Client-side caching involves using JavaScript to store data in the browser's local storage or session storage, where it can be accessed quickly by the application**.

Overall, caching is a powerful technique for improving performance in JavaScript, and it is used extensively in web development and other areas of software development. However, it is important to **use caching judiciously and consider the trade-offs between performance and other factors such as memory usage and data consistency**.

## What is the browser's local storage? ##
The browser's **local storage is a feature of modern web browsers that allows web developers to store small amounts of data locally on a user's computer**. Local storage **provides a way for web applications to save data between browser sessions, so that the data can be accessed quickly and easily the next time the user visits the site**.

The **local storage API is part of the Web Storage API, which is a set of web standards that define how web applications can store data locally**. The **local storage API provides a key-value store where developers can store and retrieve data using simple JavaScript commands**.

Here is an example of how **to set a value in local storage**:

		localStorage.setItem('myKey', 'myValue');

And here is an example of how **to retrieve a value from local storage**:

		const myValue = localStorage.getItem('myKey');

**Local storage data is stored in the browser's cache and is persistent between browser sessions**. This means that **if a user closes the browser and then returns to the site later, any data that was stored in local storage will still be available**. **Local storage is typically limited to a few megabytes of data, depending on the browser and the user's settings**.

**Web developers can use local storage to store user preferences, application settings, and other small amounts of data that need to be accessed frequently**. Local storage **can be a useful alternative to server-side storage for applications that do not require large amounts of data or complex data structures**. However, it is important to **be aware of the limitations of local storage and to use it judiciously to avoid impacting browser performance or user privacy**.

## Give more details about the local storage API. ##
The local storage API is part of the **Web Storage API**, which is a **set of web standards that define how web applications can store data locally**. The **local storage API provides a key-value store where developers can store and retrieve data using simple JavaScript commands**.

Here are some more details about the local storage API:

1. The **local storage API is accessed through** the `localStorage` object, which is **available in all modern web browsers**. The `localStorage` object **has several methods that can be used to set, get, and remove data from local storage**.
2. **Data stored in local storage is stored as key-value pairs, where the key is a string and the value can be any data type supported by JavaScript, including strings, numbers, and objects**.
3. **To set a value in local storage, you can use** the `setItem()` method, which **takes two arguments**: the **key to set and the value to store**. For example, `localStorage.setItem('myKey', 'myValue')` **sets the value** 'myValue' **for the key** 'myKey'.
4. **To retrieve a value from local storage**, you can **use** the `getItem()` method, **which takes one argument**: the **key to retrieve**. For example, `const myValue = localStorage.getItem('myKey')` **retrieves the value stored for the key 'myKey'**.
5. **To remove a value from local storage**, you can **use** the `removeItem()` method, which **takes one argument**: the **key to remove**. For example, `localStorage.removeItem('myKey')` removes the key 'myKey' and its associated value from local storage.
6. **Local storage data is persistent between browser sessions, so data stored in local storage will still be available if the user closes the browser and returns to the site later**. However, **local storage is typically limited to a few megabytes of data, depending on the browser and the user's settings**.
7. **Local storage is a client-side storage mechanism, meaning that the data is stored on the user's computer and is not sent to the server with each request**. This **can help reduce server load and improve application performance**.

Overall, the local storage API is a powerful and flexible mechanism for storing small amounts of data locally in the browser. By using the local storage API, **web developers can construct web applications that can remember user preferences, store application settings, and provide a more personalized user experience**.

## How is local storage different from cookies? ##
Local storage and cookies are both mechanisms for storing data on the client side in web browsers, but they have several key differences:

1. **Storage capacity**: **Cookies can store up to 4KB of data**, while **local storage can typically store several megabytes of data**, **depending on the browser and the user's settings**. This **makes local storage a better choice for storing larger amounts of data**.
2. **Expiration**: **Cookies can have an expiration time set by the server, which means that they can be deleted after a certain period of time**. **Local storage data**, on the other hand, **remains persistent until it is explicitly deleted by the user or by the web application**.
3. **Scope**: **Cookies can be scoped to a specific domain and path, which means that they can be accessed by other pages on the same domain**. **Local storage data**, on the other hand, **is scoped to the origin (i.e., the combination of protocol, domain, and port)**, which **means that it can only be accessed by pages on the same origin**.
	1. **origin**: <protocol>://<domain>:<port>
4. **Security**: **Cookies can be intercepted and manipulated by third-party scripts, which can lead to security vulnerabilities**. **Local storage data**, on the other hand, **is not accessible to third-party scripts, which makes it more secure**.
5. **Sending to the server**: **Cookies are sent to the server with every HTTP request, which can add additional overhead and slow down the website**. **Local storage data is not automatically sent to the server, which means that it can be faster and more efficient to use for client-side data storage**.

Overall, **local storage is a more flexible and powerful mechanism for client-side data storage than cookies**. **Local storage provides more storage capacity, is more persistent, is more secure, and is not sent to the server with each request**. However, **cookies can still be useful for storing small amounts of data that need to be accessed by other pages on the same domain or for implementing server-side session management**.
