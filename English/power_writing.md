	1. emails
	2. essays
	3. letters

	7. etc.
2. POWER:
	1. Prepare
	2. Organize
	3. Write
	4. Evaluate
	5. Review
3. We focus on one task at a time:

## Prepare ##
1. The reason we often struggle to write is that we don't have enough ideas.
	1. Come up with good points before we write
2. Before you write a single sentence, you're going to collect ideas.
3. **To prepare: (Brainstorming)**
	1. **Note down anything that comes to mind**
	2. **Don't leave out or discard anything**
		1. Whatever we get, write it down
	3. **Don't worry about organizing ideas**
	4. **Don't worry about grammar, spelling or punctuation**
	5. **Keep doing this until you have no more ideas**
4. Example: Task:
	1. You recently purchased an item online, but you are not happy with it. Write an email of complaint to the manager of the shopping website: say what you bought, why you are not happy with it, and what action you want them to take.
		1. Brainstorming: (don't leave out any idea. Then focus on important ideas)
			1. computers
				1. laptop
				2. monitor
				3. mouse
					1. left/right (1 week - stopped working)
					2. scroll wheel (wrong direction)
				4. keyboard
			2. action:
				1. refund
				2. replace
					1. return defective unit
		2. **Talking out loud helps**
		3. **Use paper and pen instead of a computer**
	
## Organize ##
1. The goal of this stage is to produce an outline for what you're going to write
	1. Structure ideas in a logical manner
2. Throughout this stage, ask this question: "How do I guide my reader?"
	1. **Think of yourserlf as a tour guide** (imagine that we are taking our reader to a tour of a great place)
		1. **What should the reader read first?**
		2. **What should the reader read next?**
		3. **What should the reader read last?**
3. **To organize:**
	1. **From the ideas you've collected, select the best ones**
	2. **Arrange the ideas in the most logical sequence**
4. Example:
	1. mouse
		1. right click
			1. 2 days
			2. 1 week
		2. scroll wheel
			1. wrong direction
	2. action
		1. replace
			1. return defective unit
	3. Organizing:
		1. I bought a mouse online.
			1. It has two problems
				1. Right mouse button had issues 2 days after it arrived
				2. Not it's been a week and it has stopped working completely
			2. Scroll wheel is making the screen go in the wrong direction
			3. I would like to ask the company to replace the mouse and I can return the defective one.
5. **A good outline should have all the ideas we need and it must be well organized**

## Write ##
1. Take the ideas in your outline and write full sentences for them.
2. Treat this as only your first draft
	1. Don't worry about:
		1. grammar
		2. vocabulary
		3. spelling
		4. punctuation
3. **Go with the flow and write some sentences**
4. **Come back and correct the mistakes later**
	1. **We may need to write correct sentences in the first draft in an exam** (no time)
5. If you:
	1. Come up with additional ideas
	2. Want to remove something
	3. Move ideas around
		1. It's OK!
6. Outline:

		I am writing to complain about a computer mouse I purchased recently from your webpage. (purpose)
		Two days later, I have noticed that the right click button has problems and is not responding well to clicks. Now it has been a week and the right click has completely stopped working. 
		Another problem is that the scroll wheel is making the screen go in the wrong direction.
		I would like to request you for a replacement. I can return the defective unit.
		The order number is xxxxxx and it was purchased on xxxxxxx
		
		Instructor's draft:
		
		Dear Sir/Madam,
		
		I am writing to complain about a computer mouse I purchased recently form your webpage. Two days after I received the mouse, the right-click button becan acting up. It has now been a week since the mouse arrived and the button has stopped working completely Moreover, the scroll wheel have started to act erratically, sometimes making the screen scroll in the wrong direction. Clearly, this mouse is a defective unit.
		I would appreciate it, if you could sent me a replacement immediately. I can return the defective product in the original packaging to the delivery guy.
