# Redis Architecture #
## What algorithm is used to distribute data in a Redis cluster? ##

Redis Cluster uses a hash slot-based data distribution algorithm to distribute data across multiple Redis nodes within the cluster. This algorithm ensures that keys are evenly distributed among the nodes while allowing for scalability and fault tolerance.

Here's how the hash slot-based data distribution algorithm works in Redis Cluster:

1. **Partitioning Data into Hash Slots:** Redis Cluster divides the entire key space into 16,384 hash slots, numbered from 0 to 16,383. Each hash slot represents a portion of the total data set.

2. **Keys Mapping to Hash Slots:** When a client sends a command to a Redis Cluster node, the cluster calculates the hash slot for the key within that command using a hash function. The hash function ensures that the same key will always map to the same hash slot, providing consistency in data distribution.

3. **Assignment to Nodes:** Redis Cluster automatically assigns each hash slot to one of the cluster nodes. Each node can be responsible for multiple hash slots. This assignment is determined through a distributed agreement among the nodes, and the information is maintained in a cluster state table.

4. **Node Failover:** Redis Cluster uses a consensus algorithm to monitor the health of nodes and perform failover when a node becomes unreachable. When a master node fails, one of the slave nodes for the failed master is promoted to become the new master for the affected hash slots, ensuring high availability.

5. **Query Routing:** Clients connect to any node in the cluster, and that node acts as a coordinator. When a client issues a command, the coordinator node calculates the hash slot for the key in the command, determines the responsible node for that hash slot based on the cluster state, and forwards the command to the appropriate node. This ensures that the client can access data across the entire cluster seamlessly.

By using this hash slot-based distribution mechanism, Redis Cluster achieves both load balancing and fault tolerance. It ensures that data is distributed across nodes in a balanced manner while allowing the cluster to adapt to changes in the cluster's topology, such as node additions and failures.

Keep in mind that Redis Cluster also supports replicas for each master node, providing data redundancy and high availability. The replicas inherit the hash slot assignments from their corresponding masters and can take over if a master fails.

This approach makes Redis Cluster a suitable solution for distributed caching and data storage scenarios where scalability, performance, and fault tolerance are essential.
