# Server Side Discovery #
## What server-side load balancing library or framework can be used in a Spring Boot application? ##
There are several server-side load balancing libraries and frameworks that can be used in a Spring Boot application. Here are a few examples:

1. **Ribbon** - **Ribbon is a popular client-side load balancing library that can also be used for server-side load balancing in a Spring Boot application**. It provides several load-balancing algorithms and integrates well with other Spring Cloud components.
2. **Zuul** - Zuul is a gateway service that can be used for server-side load balancing and routing in a Spring Boot application. It can also provide features like rate limiting, authentication, and routing based on headers.
3. **Spring Cloud LoadBalancer** - Spring Cloud LoadBalancer is a library that provides an abstraction layer over different load-balancing implementations. It integrates well with other Spring Cloud components and allows for dynamic configuration of load-balancing rules.
4. **Netflix Eureka** - Eureka is a service registry and discovery server that can be used for server-side load balancing in a Spring Boot application. It allows for automatic discovery of services and can provide a central location for managing load-balancing rules.

These are just a few examples of the many options available for server-side load balancing in a Spring Boot application. The choice of library or framework will depend on the specific needs of your application and the level of control and customization you require.

2. **Consul** - Consul is a service mesh solution that provides service discovery, service mesh, and configuration management. It can be used for server-side discovery in a Spring Boot application and provides a rich set of features for managing services.
3. **ZooKeeper** - ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. It can be used for server-side discovery in a Spring Boot application and provides strong consistency guarantees.
4. **Spring Cloud Discovery** - Spring Cloud Discovery is a library that provides an abstraction layer over different discovery implementations. It integrates well with other Spring Cloud components and allows for dynamic configuration of discovery rules.
