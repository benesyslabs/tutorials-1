# Client Side UI Composition Pattern #
## What is the client-side UI composition pattern in the context of microservices patterns? ##
In the context of microservices patterns, client-side UI composition is a pattern in which **the user interface of an application is composed by the client-side code, typically using JavaScript frameworks, by consuming multiple microservices that provide the necessary data and functionality**.

In this pattern, the **UI is divided into smaller, reusable components that can be assembled on the client-side to construct a coherent interface**. **Each of these components corresponds to a microservice, which provides the necessary data and functionality for that component**. The **client-side code then combines these components to construct the final UI**.

The advantage of this pattern is that it allows for greater flexibility and scalability in the development of complex applications. Because the UI is composed on the client-side, the microservices can be developed and deployed independently, without affecting the overall UI. This allows for faster development cycles and easier maintenance of the application.

However, it's worth noting that this pattern also comes with some challenges. The client-side code must be carefully designed to ensure that it can handle errors and manage dependencies between the different microservices. Additionally, security considerations must be taken into account, as client-side code can be manipulated by malicious actors.

## What frameworks are available to implement the client-side UI composition pattern? ##
There are several frameworks and libraries available to implement the client-side UI composition pattern in the context of microservices. Some popular ones are:

1. **React**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a component-based approach to building UIs, which is well-suited for the client-side UI composition pattern.
2. **Angular**: Angular is a JavaScript framework for building web applications. It provides a component-based architecture, along with a powerful set of features for building complex UIs.
3. **Vue.js**: Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It provides a reactive and component-based architecture, which is ideal for implementing the client-side UI composition pattern.
4. **Web Components**: Web Components are **a set of web platform APIs that allow developers to create reusable components for the web**. They **provide a standard way to define custom HTML elements and encapsulate their functionality and styling**.
5. **Micro Frontends**: Micro Frontends is a design pattern for building web applications as a composition of loosely coupled, independently deployable components. It allows for a flexible and scalable approach to building UIs, which is well-suited for the client-side UI composition pattern.

Overall, the choice of framework will depend on the specific needs and requirements of the project. Developers should consider factors such as the size and complexity of the application, the skillset of the development team, and the available resources when selecting a framework.

## Give more details about Web Components. ##
Web Components are ** set of web platform APIs that allow developers to construct reusable and interoperable custom elements for web applications**. They **provide a standard way to define and use custom HTML elements with their own encapsulated functionality and styling**.

Web Components **consist of three main technologies**: **Custom Elements**, **Shadow DOM**, and **HTML Templates**.

1. **Custom Elements**: Custom Elements **allow developers to define new HTML tags with their own behavior and properties**. Custom Elements **can be constructed using JavaScript, and once registered with the browser, can be used just like any other HTML tag**. This **makes it easy to construct and use custom elements that are reusable across different web applications**.
2. **Shadow DOM**: Shadow DOM **allows developers to construct a scoped DOM subtree within an element, which is not affected by external styles or scripts**. This **allows for encapsulation of styles and scripts within the component, preventing conflicts with other elements on the page**. Shadow DOM **also enables developers to construct more complex user interfaces with nested components, without worrying about the styles and scripts of the parent page affecting the child components**.
3. **HTML Templates**: HTML Templates **allow developers to define reusable blocks of HTML that can be cloned and inserted into the DOM as needed**. This **provides a convenient way to define and reuse UI components without having to construct them dynamically using JavaScript**.

Web Components are **designed to be interoperable and can be used with any web framework or library**. They **also work across different browsers, thanks to polyfills that provide backwards compatibility for older browsers**.

Overall, Web Components provide a powerful way to construct reusable and encapsulated UI components, which can be used across different web applications without worrying about conflicts or dependencies. This **makes it easier to construct and maintain complex web applications, and also encourages a more modular and reusable approach to web development**.

## Give an example of Web Components. ##
Sure! Here is a simple example of a Web Component that displays a custom button:

		<!-- Define the template for the custom button -->
		<template id="custom-button-template">
		  <button class="custom-button">
			<slot></slot>
		  </button>
		</template>

		<!-- Define the custom button element -->
		<script>
		  class CustomButton extends HTMLElement {
			constructor() {
			  super();
			  // Create a Shadow DOM for the custom element
			  this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
			  // Retrieve the template and clone it into the Shadow DOM
			  const template = document.getElementById('custom-button-template');
			  const clone = template.content.cloneNode(true);
			  this.shadowRoot.appendChild(clone);
			}
		  }
		  // Register the custom element with the browser
		  customElements.define('custom-button', CustomButton);
		</script>

		<!-- Use the custom button element -->
		<custom-button>Click me!</custom-button>
		
In this example, we define a custom button element using the class syntax of JavaScript. The constructor method creates a Shadow DOM for the custom element, retrieves the template defined in the HTML <template> element, and clones it into the Shadow DOM.

The <slot> element in the template is used to insert the content of the custom button element. This allows us to use the custom button with different labels, without having to modify the component itself.

Finally, we register the custom element using the customElements.define() method, which allows the browser to recognize the custom element and treat it as a standard HTML element. We can then use the custom button element just like any other HTML element, as shown in the last line of the example.

This is just a simple example, but Web Components can be used to create much more complex and powerful UI components, which can be reused across different web applications.
