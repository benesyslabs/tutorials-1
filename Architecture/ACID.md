# ACID #
## What are the different isolation levels in ACID? ##
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, which are the **four properties that ensure reliable and transactional processing of data in a database**. Isolation is one of the key properties of ACID, and **it refers to the ability of the database to ensure that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other**. **There are several isolation levels in ACID, which determine how transactions interact with each other**. The **most commonly used isolation levels are**:

1. **Read Uncommitted**: In this isolation level, transactions are **not isolated from each other**, and **a transaction can read data that has been modified by another transaction, but not yet committed**. This **can lead to dirty reads, which can compromise data consistency**.
2. **Read Committed**: In this isolation level, **a transaction can only read data that has been committed by another transaction**. This **prevents dirty reads, but can still result in non-repeatable reads and phantom reads**.
3. **Repeatable Read**: In this isolation level, **a transaction can only read data that has been committed by another transaction, and the data remains consistent throughout the transaction**. This **prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads, but can still result in phantom reads**.
4. **Serializable**: In this isolation level, **transactions are completely isolated from each other, and the database ensures that transactions are executed in a serializable order**. This **prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads, but can be slower and less scalable than other isolation levels**.

The choice of isolation level depends on the specific needs and requirements of the application. Generally, **higher isolation levels provide better data consistency, but can also lead to lower concurrency and performance**. **Lower isolation levels provide higher concurrency and performance, but can lead to data inconsistencies and other problems**. It is important to carefully consider the trade-offs and choose the appropriate isolation level for each transaction.

## What are phantom reads? ##
Phantom reads are a type of transaction anomaly that can occur in a database system **when a transaction reads data that has been inserted or deleted by another transaction that has not yet committed its changes**. In other words, **a phantom read occurs when a transaction reads a set of rows that satisfy a certain condition, but a second transaction inserts or deletes a row that also satisfies that condition before the first transaction is committed, causing the first transaction to see a different set of rows when it reads the data again**.

**Phantom reads can lead to data inconsistency and unexpected behavior in applications that rely on consistent data**. For example, if a banking application allows two customers to withdraw funds from the same account at the same time, a phantom read could result in an incorrect account balance being displayed to one or both customers.

**To prevent phantom reads, database systems typically use locking mechanisms and higher isolation levels**. For example, the **Serializable isolation level in ACID transactions ensures that all transactions are executed in a serializable order, which prevents phantom reads but can also lead to lower concurrency and performance**. **Alternatively, database systems can use multi-version concurrency control (MVCC), which allows transactions to read data from a consistent snapshot of the database at a specific point in time, preventing phantom reads while still maintaining high concurrency and performance**.

## Give an example of a phantom read. ##
Sure, here's an example of a phantom read:

Suppose we have two transactions running concurrently on a database that contains a table of orders, with the following data:

Order ID	Customer ID	Order Date	Total Amount
1	100	2023-04-01	100.00
2	101	2023-04-02	50.00
3	102	2023-04-03	200.00

Transaction A executes the following SQL query:

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date >= '2023-04-02'

This query retrieves all orders with an order date on or after April 2, 2023, which includes orders 2 and 3.

Meanwhile, Transaction B inserts a new order into the database:

INSERT INTO orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount) VALUES (4, 103, '2023-04-04', 75.00)

This inserts a new order with order ID 4, customer ID 103, order date of April 4, 2023, and a total amount of $75.00.

Transaction A then executes the same SQL query again:

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date >= '2023-04-02'

However, this time, the result set includes orders 2, 3, and 4, even though order 4 did not exist when Transaction A first executed the query. This is a phantom read, because the result set "phantomly" included an additional row that was inserted by Transaction B after Transaction A had already executed the initial query.

This example illustrates the potential for data inconsistencies and unexpected behavior in applications that rely on consistent data, and highlights the importance of preventing phantom reads through the use of appropriate isolation levels or concurrency control mechanisms in database systems.

## How does a phantom read result in inconsistency? ##
A phantom read can result in inconsistency because **it can cause a transaction to see a different set of rows when it reads the data again, which can lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior**.

In the example of a phantom read that I gave earlier, suppose that Transaction A had performed some calculation based on the total amount of orders retrieved by its initial query, and assumed that the result was accurate. However, when Transaction A re-executed the query and retrieved an additional row due to the insertion by Transaction B, the total amount of orders would have increased, leading to a different result and potentially incorrect calculations or decisions.

This is just one example of how a phantom read can result in inconsistency. **Depending on the nature of the application and the data being accessed, phantom reads can have a variety of negative consequences, such as incorrect financial transactions, incorrect inventory management, or incorrect decision-making based on out-of-date or inconsistent data**.

To prevent phantom reads and ensure consistency in data access, database systems **use various techniques such as locking, snapshot isolation, and multi-version concurrency control**. These techniques ensure that transactions access data in a consistent and isolated manner, and prevent anomalies such as phantom reads.

## What is muti-version concurrency control? ##
Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) is a technique used by database management systems **to allow multiple transactions to access the same data concurrently, while still ensuring consistency and isolation**. **MVCC works by constructing multiple versions of a data item, each corresponding to a specific point in time, and allowing transactions to read from a consistent snapshot of the database at a specific point in time**.

In an MVCC system, **each transaction sees a snapshot of the database as it existed at the beginning of the transaction, and only operates on the data in that snapshot**. This **ensures that each transaction sees a consistent view of the data, even if other transactions are modifying the same data concurrently**. **If a transaction attempts to modify a data item that has been modified by another transaction, the system detects the conflict and either aborts the transaction or rolls it back, depending on the transaction isolation level**.

MVCC **allows for high concurrency and performance in database systems, as transactions can read data without holding locks or blocking other transactions**. It **also enables non-blocking read-only transactions, as these transactions do not need to acquire any locks and can read from a consistent snapshot of the database**.

MVCC is **used in many database management systems, including PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server, and is a key technique for ensuring consistency and isolation in high-concurrency environments**.

## Give an example of MVCC. ##
MVCC, or Multi-Version Concurrency Control, is a database concurrency control technique that allows multiple transactions to access the same data simultaneously without interfering with each other.

Here is an example of MVCC in action:

Suppose we have a database table with two columns: "Name" and "Age". Initially, the table is empty.

Transaction 1 begins and inserts a row into the table with the values "John" and "30".
Transaction 2 begins and also inserts a row into the table with the values "Mary" and "35".

Now, both transactions have written to the same table, but they have not interfered with each other because each transaction has its own "snapshot" of the database at the time it began.

Suppose that now, Transaction 1 executes a SELECT statement to retrieve the "Name" and "Age" columns. It will see its own inserted row with the values "John" and "30".

Next, Transaction 2 executes a SELECT statement to retrieve the same columns. It will see its own inserted row with the values "Mary" and "35".

Both transactions have read from the same table at the same time, but each transaction has seen only its own data. This is possible because MVCC creates a separate version of the data for each transaction, which allows for concurrent reads and writes without interference.
