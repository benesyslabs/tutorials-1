# Lambda Architecture #
## What is Lambda architecture? ##
Lambda architecture is **a data processing architecture designed to handle large-scale, real-time data processing**. It **combines batch processing, stream processing, and a serving layer to handle both historical and real-time data**.

The architecture is **composed of three main layers**:

1. **Batch Layer**: **This layer handles** the **large-scale processing of historical data**. It **uses distributed processing systems like Apache Hadoop, and processes data in a batch-oriented manner, producing batch views of the data**. The **batch views are immutable and provide a complete, accurate view of the data**.
2. **Speed Layer**: This **layer processes real-time data streams in a fast and scalable way**. It **uses systems like Apache Storm or Apache Flink to process data in real-time and construct views that are partial and approximate**. **These views are used to provide up-to-date information to the user**.
3. **Serving Layer**: This **layer serves the batch views and real-time views to the end-users**. It **uses a query engine like Apache Spark or Apache HBase to serve queries on the batch views, and a real-time database like Apache Cassandra or Apache HBase to serve queries on the real-time views**.

The **idea behind the lambda architecture is to have a fault-tolerant, scalable, and easy-to-maintain system that can handle both historical and real-time data processing**. It **ensures that data is processed in a timely and accurate manner, allowing users to make informed decisions based on both current and historical data**.

## Give more details about the serving layer. ##
The **serving layer in the Lambda Architecture is responsible for serving the results of batch and speed layers to the end-users in a queryable format**. It is **designed to provide low-latency queries on both the historical and real-time data**.

The **serving layer can be implemented using various technologies, including NoSQL databases like HBase, Cassandra, or MongoDB, and in-memory data stores like Redis or Memcached**. The **choice of technology depends on the specific requirements of the application and the type of queries that need to be supported**.

The **serving layer contains both the batch views and the real-time views**, which are **integrated to provide a unified view of the data**. The **batch views are usually stored in a distributed file system like HDFS or S3**, and **can be queried using query engines like Apache Hive, Apache Spark, or Apache Drill**.

The **real-time views**, on the other hand, **are stored in a NoSQL database like HBase or Cassandra, and can be queried using APIs like HBase API or Cassandra Query Language (CQL)**.

**To serve queries on both the batch and real-time views, the serving layer may use a variety of techniques, such as caching, pre-aggregation, and indexing. The goal is to provide fast query response times and minimize the amount of data that needs to be scanned.

**One of the advantages of the serving layer in the Lambda Architecture is its ability to handle incremental updates to the data**. **As new data arrives in the speed layer, the serving layer can update the real-time views and integrate them with the existing batch views**. This **allows the serving layer to provide a unified view of the data that is always up-to-date**.

Overall, the **serving layer in the Lambda Architecture is a critical component that provides low-latency, queryable access to both historical and real-time data**. Its design and implementation require careful consideration of the specific application requirements and the available technologies.

## How can the serving layer integrate real-time views with existing batch views? ##
Integrating real-time views with existing batch views in the serving layer can be done in several ways. Here are a few common approaches:

1. **Merging**: In this approach, the **real-time views are merged with the batch views to construct a unified view of the data**. The **merged data is then stored in a database that can handle both batch and real-time queries**. For example, a NoSQL database like HBase can be used to store both batch and real-time data and provide low-latency queries.
2. **Appending**: In this approach, the real-time views are appended to the existing batch views to create an updated version of the batch views. The updated batch views are then stored in a distributed file system like HDFS or S3. This approach is useful when the real-time views are small and can be easily appended to the batch views.
3. **Delta processing**: In this approach, the real-time views are processed as a series of incremental updates to the batch views. The updates are applied to the batch views in a way that preserves the accuracy of the batch views. For example, the updates can be applied to the existing batch views using MapReduce or Spark jobs.
4. **Caching**: In this approach, the real-time views are cached in memory and used to augment the batch views. The cached data can be updated periodically to ensure that it is up-to-date. This approach is useful when low-latency access to the real-time views is required.

The choice of approach depends on the specific requirements of the application and the characteristics of the data. For example, if the real-time views are small and updated frequently, appending or caching may be more appropriate. On the other hand, if the real-time views are large and updated less frequently, merging or delta processing may be more appropriate.

## Why is the Speed Layer partial and approximate? ##
The Speed Layer in the Lambda Architecture is designed to handle the real-time processing of data and provide low-latency query results. However, it is often **partial and approximate because it only processes a subset of the data, and the processing is done in a fast but potentially less accurate manner**.

There are **several reasons why the Speed Layer may be partial and approximate**:

1. **Limited processing time**: The **Speed Layer has a limited amount of time to process data in real-time, which means that it can only process a subset of the data**. This **subset may be determined by time constraints or by data sampling techniques**.
2. **Data loss**: In some cases, r**eal-time data may be lost due to network issues, hardware failures, or other issues**. This **can lead to incomplete or partial data processing in the Speed Layer**.
3. **Approximation techniques**: To provide low-latency query results, the Speed Layer may use **approximation techniques like sampling or statistical aggregation, which may produce approximate or partial results**.

Despite its partial and approximate nature, the Speed Layer is still useful in providing real-time insights into the data. The partial and approximate results can be combined with the more accurate results from the Batch Layer to provide a unified view of the data. The combination of both the Batch Layer and the Speed Layer provides a complete and accurate view of the data over time.

## What data sampling techniques are used in the speed layer? ##
In the Speed Layer of the Lambda Architecture, data sampling techniques may be used to process a subset of the data in real-time. Here are **some common data sampling techniques used in the Speed Layer**:

1. **Random Sampling**: In this technique, a **random subset of the data is selected for processing** in the Speed Layer. This approach **works well when there is no specific criteria for selecting the data subset**.
2. **Stratified Sampling**: In this technique, the **data is divided into strata or subgroups based on certain characteristics such as time or location**, and **then a sample is selected from each stratum**. This **approach can provide more representative samples, especially when the data has significant variations across different strata**.
3. **Systematic Sampling**: In this technique, **a fixed interval is used to select data points from the data stream**. For **example, every nth data point may be selected for processing in the Speed Layer**. **This approach can be useful when the data is sorted in some order, such as time or ID**.
4. **Reservoir Sampling**: In this technique, **a random sample is selected from an infinite or unknown data stream**. The **sample is chosen by maintaining a reservoir of a fixed size and randomly replacing elements in the reservoir as new data arrives**. This **approach is useful when the data stream is too large to store in memory**.

The **choice of sampling technique depends on the specific requirements of the application and the characteristics of the data**. For example, **random sampling may be suitable for applications where the data is evenly distributed**, while **stratified sampling may be more appropriate for data with significant variations across different subgroups**. The **goal is to select a representative subset of the data that can be processed in real-time while providing accurate and useful insights**.

## How is the sampling implemented? ##
The implementation of data sampling techniques in the Speed Layer of the Lambda Architecture can vary depending on the specific requirements of the application and the characteristics of the data. Here are some common ways that sampling may be implemented:

1. **Random Sampling**: Random sampling can be implemented by **selecting a random subset of the data based on a uniform distribution**. This **can be done using a random number generator or by using a hash function to select random data points**. The **size of the subset can be fixed or determined dynamically based on factors such as available processing resources or the rate of incoming data**.
2. **Stratified Sampling**: Stratified sampling can be **implemented by dividing the data into strata or subgroups based on certain characteristics such as time or location, and then selecting a sample from each stratum**. This **can be done using SQL queries or other filtering techniques**. The **size of each stratum can be fixed or determined dynamically based on the characteristics of the data**.
3. **Systematic Sampling**: Systematic sampling can be implemented by **selecting data points at a fixed interval or using a sliding window approach**. This **can be done using a modulo operator or other indexing techniques**. The **size of the interval or window can be fixed or determined dynamically based on the characteristics of the data**.
4. **Reservoir Sampling**: Reservoir sampling can be **implemented by maintaining a fixed-size reservoir of data points and randomly replacing elements in the reservoir as new data arrives**. This **can be done using a circular buffer or a priority queue**. The **size of the reservoir can be fixed or determined dynamically based on the characteristics of the data**.

Once the subset of data has been selected using the appropriate sampling technique, **it can be processed in real-time using techniques such as aggregation or filtering**. The **results of the processing can then be stored in a database or other data store for use by the Serving Layer**.

## How is the merging between real-time views and batch views implemented? ##
The merging of real-time views and batch views in the Serving Layer of the Lambda Architecture can be implemented using various techniques depending on the specific requirements of the application and the characteristics of the data. Here are some common ways that merging may be implemented:

1. **Batch View Overwrite**: In this approach, the batch view is recomputed periodically (e.g., every day) based on the full set of data, and the entire batch view is overwritten in the Serving Layer. The real-time view is merged with the updated batch view as new data arrives. This approach provides a complete and accurate view of the data but can be slow to update.
2. **Batch View Incremental Update**: In this approach, the batch view is recomputed periodically (e.g., every hour) based on the changes in the data since the last computation. The updated batch view is then merged with the real-time view in the Serving Layer. This approach provides a more up-to-date view of the data but requires additional processing resources to compute the incremental updates.
3. **Hybrid Approach**: In this approach, a combination of batch view overwrite and incremental update is used. The batch view is recomputed periodically but is also updated incrementally based on changes in the data. The real-time view is merged with both the updated batch view and the incremental updates. This approach provides a balance between accuracy and timeliness.
4. **Delta Architecture**: In this approach, the **Serving Layer maintains both a historical batch view and a set of incremental updates, which are applied to the batch view as new data arrives**. The **real-time view is then merged with the resulting view**. This **approach provides a more scalable and fault-tolerant solution than the other approaches, but it requires additional processing and storage resources to maintain the incremental updates**.

Once the real-time view and batch view have been merged in the Serving Layer, the combined view can be queried by users or downstream applications to provide insights into the data. The specific implementation of the merging technique depends on the specific requirements of the application and the characteristics of the data.

## Give more details about the Delta Architecture. ##
The **Delta Architecture is an extension of the Lambda Architecture that addresses some of the limitations of the original architecture**, **particularly around the complexity and cost of maintaining two separate code paths for batch and real-time processing**. The **Delta Architecture adds a third layer, called the "Speed Layer 2," to the architecture, which eliminates the need for a separate batch layer and provides a more scalable and fault-tolerant solution**.

In the Delta Architecture, the **Speed Layer 2 receives real-time data from the same sources as the original Speed Layer, but instead of writing the data directly to the serving layer, it writes the data to a message queue or a log store such as Apache Kafka or Apache Pulsar**. The **serving layer now maintains two views of the data: a historical batch view and a set of incremental updates, which are applied to the batch view as new data arrives**. This **eliminates the need for a separate batch layer, and simplifies the processing logic required for the serving layer**.

The **incremental updates are processed in real-time using a stream processing engine such as Apache Flink or Apache Spark Streaming**. The **processing logic for the incremental updates is similar to that used in the original Speed Layer, but now includes additional logic for merging the updates with the historical batch view**. The **result of the incremental updates is a new version of the batch view, which is stored in a data store such as Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or Apache Cassandra**.

The **batch view is recomputed periodically, as in the original Lambda Architecture, but now uses the incremental updates to speed up the computation**. The **recomputed batch view is merged with the latest incremental updates in the serving layer, to produce a new version of the batch view that includes both historical data and the latest updates**.

The **Delta Architecture provides a more scalable and fault-tolerant solution than the original Lambda Architecture, as it allows for more efficient processing of real-time data and eliminates the complexity of maintaining two separate code paths for batch and real-time processing**. However, **it also requires additional processing and storage resources to maintain the incremental updates, and may be more complex to implement than the original architecture**.

## What frameworks or libraries are available to implement the Delta Architecture? ##
The **Delta Architecture is a data processing architecture designed for handling large-scale, time-series data**. While there is no specific framework or library that is tailored for implementing the Delta Architecture, there are several tools and technologies that can be used to build the various components of the architecture. Here are some examples:

1. **Apache Spark**: Apache Spark is **a distributed computing framework that can be used for both batch and streaming data processing**. Spark **provides a high-level API for working with data in both structured and unstructured formats**. It **also includes libraries for machine learning, graph processing, and SQL-like querying**.
2. **Apache Kafka**: Apache Kafka is **a distributed messaging system that can be used for real-time data streaming**. **Kafka can handle large volumes of data and provides high throughput and low latency**. **Kafka can be used as a data source for Spark or other processing engines**.

Hadoop **includes the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for storing data and MapReduce for processing data**. Hadoop **can be used in conjunction with Spark or other processing engines**.
4. **Apache Flink**: Apache Flink is **a distributed stream processing engine that can be used for real-time data processing**. Flink **provides support for batch processing as well**. Flink **includes support for windowing, stateful processing, and fault tolerance**.
5. **Apache NiFi**: Apache NiFi is **a data integration tool that can be used for ingesting, processing, and distributing data**. NiFi **provides a graphical interface for building data pipelines and includes support for routing, filtering, enrichment, and transformation**.
6. **InfluxDB**: **InfluxDB is a time-series database** that can be used **for storing and querying time-series data**. InfluxDB **includes support for high write and query throughput, clustering, and retention policies**.

These are just a few examples of the tools and technologies that can be used to implement the Delta Architecture. The specific components of the architecture will depend on the requirements of the data processing pipeline and the available resources.
