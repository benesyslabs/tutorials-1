## Does GET responses get cached in browser? ##
Yes, **GET responses can be cached in a browser based on the caching headers set by the server in the HTTP response**. The **caching behavior of a browser is determined by the Cache-Control header and other related headers**.

**When a browser receives a GET response, it checks the caching directives in the response headers to determine whether the response can be cached and for how long**. The following **headers** are **commonly used to control caching behavior**:

1. **Cache-Control**: This header specifies the caching directives for both the browser and intermediate caching proxies. Directives like "no-cache", "no-store", "public", "private", "max-age", and "s-maxage" can be set to control caching behavior.
2. **Expires**: This header specifies an absolute expiration time for the response, after which the browser will consider the response as stale and request a fresh copy from the server.
3. **Last-Modified**: This header indicates the last modification timestamp of the response. The browser can use this information to send an "If-Modified-Since" header in subsequent requests to check if the content has been modified since the last request.
4. **ETag**: This header provides a unique identifier for the response. The browser can send an "If-None-Match" header in subsequent requests using the ETag value to check if the content has changed.

**Based on the caching headers, the browser may cache the response and reuse it for subsequent requests**. If the response is considered fresh according to the caching headers, the browser may use the cached version without making a new request to the server. This can improve performance by reducing network latency and server load.

However, it's important to note that the caching behavior of a browser can be influenced by various factors, including user settings, browser configurations, and the presence of other caching mechanisms like service workers or content delivery networks (CDNs). Additionally, developers can also control caching behavior using cache control directives in server configurations or by setting response headers explicitly.
