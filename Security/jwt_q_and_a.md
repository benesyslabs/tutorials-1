# JWT #
## What is JWT? ##
JWT stands for **JSON Web Token**. It is an **open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object**. JWTs are **commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications and APIs**.

Here are some key aspects of JWT:

1. **Structure**: A **JWT consists of three parts separated by periods (".")**: the **header, the payload, and the signature**. The **three parts are Base64Url encoded and concatenated into a single string**.
2. **Header**: The **header contains metadata about the token and typically consists of two parts**: the **token type (JWT) and the signing algorithm used to secure the token** (e.g., **HMAC, RSA, or others**).
3. **Payload**: The **payload contains the claims or statements about the user or entity being authenticated**. **Claims are categorized as registered claims (predefined standard claims) or custom claims (specific to the application)**. Examples of **common claims include the subject (sub), expiration time (exp), issuer (iss), and audience (aud)**.
4. **Signature**: The signature is **generated by combining the encoded header, encoded payload, and a secret key (or private key in asymmetric algorithms) using the specified signing algorithm**. The **signature is used to verify the integrity of the token and ensure that it has not been tampered with**.
5. **Stateless and Self-Contained**: **JWTs are stateless, meaning that the server does not need to store token-related information**. **All the necessary information to validate and process the token is contained within the token itself. This makes JWTs scalable and suitable for distributed systems**.
6. **Authentication and Authorization**: JWTs are **commonly used for user authentication and authorization in web applications and APIs**. **After successful authentication, the server generates a JWT and includes it in subsequent requests as an authorization mechanism**. The **server can validate the token's signature and extract the necessary information from the payload to authorize the user**.
7. **Decentralized Trust**: **JWTs allow for a decentralized trust model**. **As long as the server knows and trusts the issuer of the token (identified by the "iss" claim), it can verify and trust the token without the need for additional communication with the issuer**.
8. **Revocation and Expiration**: **JWTs are typically designed to have a limited lifespan**. The **expiration time (specified in the "exp" claim) allows for automatic token expiration, reducing the risk of misuse**. However, **JWTs cannot be easily revoked before their expiration time since they are stateless**. **To handle revocation, additional mechanisms such as token blacklisting or short-lived tokens are often used**.

JWTs provide a flexible and widely adopted solution for secure authentication and authorization in distributed systems. They offer a **lightweight and portable way to transmit information securely between parties, enabling stateless and scalable authentication mechanisms**.

## What is HMAC? ##
HMAC stands for **Hash-based Message Authentication Code**. It is **a specific type of message authentication code that uses a cryptographic hash function in combination with a secret key to verify the integrity and authenticity of a message**.

Here are the key aspects of HMAC:

1. **Integrity and Authenticity**: HMAC provides a way to verify that a message has not been tampered with during transmission and that it originated from a trusted source. It ensures both the integrity (data has not been modified) and authenticity (data comes from the claimed sender) of the message.
2. **Cryptographic Hash Function**: HMAC utilizes a cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, as the core building block. The hash function takes an input (message) and produces a fixed-size output called a hash digest or hash value.
3. **Secret Key**: HMAC requires a secret key that is known only to the sender and the receiver. This key is shared between the two parties and is used to generate the HMAC value and verify its integrity.
4. **Keyed Hash Function**: HMAC combines the secret key with the message to be authenticated using an algorithm that applies the cryptographic hash function multiple times. The key is used to modify the internal state of the hash function, making it computationally infeasible to derive the original key from the HMAC value.
5. **Unique HMAC Value**: The result of applying the HMAC algorithm is a unique fixed-size output called the HMAC value or HMAC tag. The HMAC value is appended to the original message and transmitted along with it.
6. **Verification**: To verify the authenticity and integrity of the message, the receiver recalculates the HMAC value using the received message and the shared secret key. If the calculated HMAC value matches the received HMAC value, the message is considered authentic and intact. Any modification or tampering with the message or the HMAC value would result in a mismatch during verification.

HMAC is commonly used in various protocols and applications to ensure message integrity and authentication, such as in secure communication protocols (e.g., SSL/TLS), API authentication, token-based authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT with HMAC), and more. It provides a robust and efficient means of verifying the integrity of messages in a secure manner.
