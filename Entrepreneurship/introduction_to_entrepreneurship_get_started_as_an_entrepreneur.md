			1. Optimistic - People who think something good might happen to them in the future (they think they can get over the problems)

### Understanding the business life cycle ###
1. Big picture - macro understanding
2. All businesses have 4 distinctive phases
	1. Helps us understand how businesses transition, how do Entrepreneurial roles within the business transition, how do personalities of Entrepreneurs aid them in each section of the business
3. Business life cycle
	1. Phase #1: Pre-Launch
		1. We haven't built anything
		2. We haven't taken money from anyone
		3. Entrepreneur has spotted an opportunity and planning to tackle the market opportunity
		4. Entrepreneur has gathered resources and not yet started selling anything or bringing any money
		5. They are by themselves, or with co-founder
		6. It is a thought experiment
			1. Research
			2. Figuring out what is available and moving forward
	2. Phase #2: Startup
		1. We are taking everything done in Phase 1 and we start doing it
		2. Bring in first customers & first dollars
		3. We start hiring employees (potentially contractors)
		4. Still a small operation
		5. Entrepreneur is doing a lot of different things
			1. Anything
				1. Answering phones
				2. Doing sales
				3. Doing customer service
				4. ...
			2. It is necessary
				1. Experiencing growing pain
			3. Entrepreneur fits any role depending on what's needed
	3. Phase #3: Growth
		1. What happens after startup phase
			1. 5 to 100, 200, or 1000 people
		2. We usually see an upword trend of revenue, employees, client base
		3. Startups spend a lot of money to bring in clients as soon as possible
			1. To tackle as much of the market share
			2. To tackle as much of the market
		4. Entrepreneur settles in one role
			1. CEO who works with high level executives
			2. Or a position they are more willing to do
	4. Phase #4: Maturity
		1. Potentially decline
		2. Fortune 100, 500, 1000 are in mature stage
			1. Multiple countries, cities, offices
		3. Company is growing but growth rate is slowing down
		4. Decline
			1. Happens after the market is so well developed and saturated that profitability is taken out of the market
				1. Company selling the same product loses sales or profit
					1. Solution: Companies typically try to expand at this point or pivot into something else
						1. Companies do one thing really well, and once that product or service gets mature and decline, they split of and start doing other things simultaneously (smart companies do that - early on in the growth stage)
4. Entrepreneurs are crucial in the first 2 phases, important in the 3rd stage, generally obsolete in the 4th phase
	1. At 4th phase, they leave and do something else and replace themselves with a potential CEO
		1. At the beginning, they are everything and success of the company falls on their back
5. A lot of companies fail in all phases
	1. Even in a mature phase, they don't differentiate themselves, and end up declining into the abyss

### The different types of income ###
1. Active income vs passive income
	1. Active income - something asks us to do something and we do it and get money
		1. If you show up you make money
	2. Passive income - money that's made whether or not there is incremental work being done
		1. How?
			1. Investments - stocks goes up and made money
				1. They didn't show up any single day - no relationship to what happens to the stock
			2. Dividends - investment in utility companies or bonds (every period of time they get a payment - annuity)
				1. Money comes whether we work or not
		2. Entrepreneurs want passive income
			1. Leverage as much as possible
				1. They try to construct companies or value giving vehicles around the concept
					1. Build something (invest in something) and make more money over a long term and have a bigger ratio of passive income to active income
						1. Example: Software company giving subscriptions to a service
							1. We sign up and use a service
								1. No income rental cost to the company for sign up
									1. If many sign up, the company might have to hire one more person (high ratio of passive to active)
										1. Passive - subscriptions (some try 100% passive)
										2. Active - employees
	3. Recurring revenue
		1. Instead of selling something or doing a service and doing once and gathering money only once, users repeatedly pay as long as they use it or are a member (they are part of customer base)
			1. Entrepreneurs try to shoot for products that don't sell only once but sell multiple times
				1. Selling cheaper razers on a subscription instead of selling a razor once for $12
					1. Buy weekly (recurring revenue)
	4. Planned Obsolescence (Re-occuring revenue)
		1. iPad gets slower and seem to have bugs over time

				1. Company breaks the product after year or two

		2. They use an app and request for a service and we get it on demand immediately
	2. Sharing economy business model (or under-utilized assets)
		1. Companies want individual consumers to own things that they can share with people outside of their friends for money
			1. Airbnb
				1. Allows people to rent out their space (like hotel) and charge money for it
			2. Getaround
				1. Rent out your car to anyone
		2. Advantages
			1. Sharing is cheaper - Airbnb is cheaper than hotels (they don't charge as much)
		3. Power drill dilemma
			1. Power drills are $50 to $500
				1. Average time in a year a power drill is used is 14 minutes
					1. Hence it can be rented out for remaining time to recoup the cost (we save money)
	3. Crowdsourcing
		1. Sell something, provide content, or value online and source all the ideas or information from individual people
			1. Example: Teespring
				1. We can buy tee shirts
					1. Individual people design them (a market place)
						1. They become popular and people buy them and person who designed them gets a cut
				2. It is leveraging infinite creativity of everyone and monetizing in the process
			2. They don't come up with products or services themselves
				1. They let anybody else come up with ideas
			3. Derisking what we are trying to sell: If many vote for something or someone designs it themselves, they are taking the risk and pre-validating it (in a group of people), we know it is going to sell or not cost a lot of money (win-win)
	4. Freemium
		1. Mobile apps
			1. We can use many features of the application for free, but we can become a power user by paying
				1. Either time-bound or feature-bound
		2. Examples:
			1. Evernote - For writing notes and storing information, collaborating
				1. Free to use but pay for certain feature set
		3. Idea
			1. If somebody has not used it, it is hard to sell it to them
				1. If people try it, they're much more likely to purchase it
					1. They might get addicted to the service
					2. They might integrate it someway into their life
				2. They are much more likely to pay money and stick through their lifetime
		4. It works when it doesn't cost you anything to give it for free (another version, say)
			1. It is not good for product businesses, but okay for SaaS
				1. Games (business owner - costs nothing)
		5. Free products on the other hand take significant money on our end and potentially lose money because we are paying
	5. Direct to consumer business model
		1. Consider a business sold in retail, large grocery stores, department stores, ... we sell that directly to someone through the internet
			1. Example: Dell Computers
				1. We can only buy them from their website (not Walmart, Best Buy, ...)
					1. They can keep the prices low, because they don't pay any money to the retailers
					2. No dealing with logistics, and shipping it around the world, figure out how many needs to be shipped etc.
				2. Customer approach, buy, and the product is shipped
			2. Example: Warby Parker
				1. Visual simulator to put on the glasses and they are shipped
				2. We can try them for a couple of days and if it is good, we buy them
		2. Delivering convenience (otherwise might require a lot of effort to get the basics done)
	6. Other business models - resources

### Scalability ###
1. What is scalability?
	1. Is it easy to take the business we have conceptualized and grow to 1000s or 100s of 1000s or millions of customers
		1. Does it scale cleanly
		2. Side-businesses are not concerned except a little
		3. Lifestyle businesses are concerned to a medium level
		4. Startup - very important concept
	2. If you cannot scale past a certain point, you have reached a limit
		1. Selling to first customer has unique challenges
		2. Selling to next 10 customers has its own unique challenges
		3. Selling to next 100 or 1000 have their own unique challenges
	3. Example:
		1. Food for 10 people
			1. Make it for 10 people, make it delicious and find a location where you can sell them to 10 people
		2. To sell food to 10k
			1. We need to make a production line to produce them and have enough of it on time so that it doesn't go spoiled
			2. We need to have logistics
			3. We need to have warehousing
			4. We need to have shipping
			5. Taxes
			6. Healthcode
2. How can we tell if a business is scalable?
	1. Does your business have a lot of marginal cost?
		1. Marginal cost - Everything we sell something, how much does it cost us?
			1. For some businesses, it cost a penny but can be sold for $10
			2. For some businesses, it costs $7 but can be sold for $10
		2. SaaS - It doesn't cost anything but server cost and bandwidth
			1. Very scalable
		3. Hard to sell products or services
			1. Painting
				1. Hard to scale - we are core to making the product so cannot clone or duplicate myself
					1. We cannot sell a 1000 of them if we cannot physically make a 1000 of them
	2. Scalability depends on your market
		1. Large markets are easier to scale
		2. Small markets could be a problem
			1. If we are making a vaccine that cures a disease only 10 people have
				1. Not scalable because once we hit 10, we cannot sell anymore
3. Entrepreneurs must worry about the two and take them into consideration
	1. We don't want to sell something that ultimately becomes a burden on myself
		1. Business coaching or lifestyle coaching doesn't scale very well
			1. Each customer needs more time from you
				1. How to make it scalable?
					1. Put all your info and make an online course - marginal cost is very minimal
4. Startups need scalability
	1. If we are not scalable, we cannot grow big
	2. If we don't grow big, we cannot get big investments
	3. Sometimes we need big investments

### Section 5 review material ###
### Quiz 4: Review of core business concepts ###

## Section 6: Validating your idea ##
### What is validation? ###
1. Validation - recent
	1. Essential part of the process
		1. It is how Entrepreneurs figure out before they jump into something, before they spend a lot of time, and money, and marketing about the great idea they have. How do they know whether or not it is going to succeed?
			1. No one know for a fact
				1. But we can do many things that if done well and gives a general indication of whether it will more likely succeed
	2. This step happens between
		1. Noticing the problem, opportunity & conceptuatlization (putting a solution)
	3. It's an optional step
	4. It's becoming the standard
		1. Spending a minimum amount of time testing out or doing basic experiments to see whether there is demand or whether the opportunity is real
	5. Problem solved:
		1. Ideas always sound great in your head, but if you don't get them out in the market, you don't know whether or not they are good.
			1. Erid Ries: "When you're in the shower and we have an idea, boy, does it sound great. But in reality, most of our ideas are actually quite terrible."
				1. True for Entrepreneurs with any experience
	6. Validation is an opportunity to minimize the risk of persuing a venture
		1. Crucial

### Surveys ###
1. Technique for validating business
	1. Conduct a survey
		1. Basic way
		2. Easiest way
		3. Works on: The wisdom of crowds
			1. If ask a question to several people, they are more often than not correct than if you ask one or two
				1. Ask more people about your idea & ask as many people as possible
					1. 100 people can come up with a consensus
		4. Why do you survey?
			1. Survey one or two groups:
				1. People who are in the industry you're targetting (the space we are entering or going after)
					1. They have info that we don't have
					2. They can give judgement about whether or not they could visualize happening and being successful
				2. Potential customers (of product or service)
					1. They might tell you if they personally would purchase our product
		5. When surveying
			1. Tell them why the idea is great - Try to be objective
				1. Don't pitch at them at what you are doing (it's going to be biased. If you already show what you are doing is great, they are much more likely to say yes - skews data. When the actual customers buy it, they don't have the same scenario - Avoid false positives)
					1. Sit, listen and gather as much information about the context of the business idea as much as possible
						1. How to do it?
							1. Lead them into it
								1. **Ask questions about the space & about the problem we are trying to solve**
2. What to ask?
	1. Customers:
		1. Do they have the problem that you're trying to solve?
		2. What solutions the have used to tackle the problem before?
	2. Industry people:
		1. Do they think this problem actually exists?
			1. Did they observe?
		2. Would people pay money for a solution?
3. As a next step:
	1. Then give a solution to the problem and ask if they are enthusiastic about it
		1. Explain your solution objectively (don't give subjective opinions)
	2. How much would they pay for it potentially
4. How to do surveys?
	1. SurveyMoney
	2. AWeber
	3. Google Forms
		1. Spread the link
5. How to find participants for the survey?
	1. Your immediate network (they are easy to get to fill out the survey)
		1. Do you know if there is anyone in the industry?
		2. Do you know if anyone would buy it?
	2. Industry groups, forums, meetings (where people gather and are potentially interested in the solution)
		1. Reddit - giant forum
			1. Subreddits
				1. Pitching business ideas
				2. New Entrepreneurs
				3. SaaS
			2. Tell them we want to validate an idea and solve a problem and we would be very greatful for their time
			3. Try to incentivize them to answer
	3. Make it short - make it as painless as possible
		1. 1/2 page to a full page
6. Service to use:
	1. Ask your target market (aytm)
		1. pay per survey answerer
		2. They deal with finding people & getting them to finish it & make sure they fit the demographics and interests
7. Facebook groups
	1. Start asking questions

### Talking to experts ###
1. Asking experts in the industry we are trying to enter
	1. Experts have experience going into the industry we are trying to enter
	2. Experts have insights and potentially trade secrets or potentially inside information that we otherwise would not have access to
	3. Not everyone is good at seeing whether or not an idea is good but they have more information to pull for so their answers are more accurate
	4. They could know whether the idea has been tried before
	5. They would potentially know if there is a block or barrier that will prevent you from entirely pursuing it
		1. Example an expert might say it is illegal
			1. Example: Selling cars from a website
				1. 48 - 50 states - illegal
					1. US has a law that says you can buy cars only from certified dealers
2. How to contact industry experts
	1. Email
		1. More likely to respond
	2. Phone - a pain for them
	3. In person - most preferred
		1. To get most information
3. Steps:
	1. Identify experts in your area
		1. Search through blog and newscontent - to check if there is anyone who writes on your topic or has written something related to the product, service or industry
			1. use search engines dedicated to blogs or news outlets
	2. Contact them
	3. Show them that you read what they wrote
	4. Present your idea and ask for feedback 
		1. In one or two sentences
		2. If the idea piques their interest, real them in and actually have a conversation
	5. Present your idea and aks for feedback
		1. Say you want to solve a problem and I need 5 minutes of your time
		2. Say: "I am working on this, would you like to know more. I want your thoughts and feedback"
4. Linked In
	1. Search - Based of of hierarchy of their job or specific title they have
		1. Look for space we are going to enter into
			1. If they currently in the space, they could have some information
			2. If they worked in the space previously, they are more likely to divulge information (they are not attached to it anymore)
		2. Look for company with which we are potentially going to compete
	2. Be nice and offer to incentivise them
		1. Buy lunch
		2. Buy coffee
		3. ...
	3. Make sure to convey that we appreciate their time
	4. Industry experts might be busy so we might need to try multiple times
	5. Contact as many industry experts as we can
	6. Ensure we have as many conversations as we can

### The lean startup framework ###
1. Defacto way for startups to tackle business
2. Framework - Lean Startup
	1. We don't know if our idea is good, we only make assumptions (set of assumptions)
	2. Any business idea comes with a set of assumptions
		1. Two ways to tackle the assumptions
			1. Building a solution
				1. Spend money
				2. Spend time
				3. We get feedback
				4. Change the product based off of feedback
			2. The lean startup framework
				1. Do as minimum amount of work as possible to see if the customers use it
				2. Take the feedback and insert it back into the process
				3. Build the product and repeat the above process
				4. It is a system of running rapid experiments
					1. Experiments that give you information (true information that came from customers)
	3. Cycle:
		1. Build - Measure - Learn
			1. Build something
			2. Measure it's success, interaction, how customers react to it, what they use, what they like, what they don't like
			3. We take that information and learn and figure out what we did wrong, make correct, and rebuild and restart the process
	4. Stop making things that people don't want to buy
		1. Saving time and resources
		2. Focus on adapting faster
		3. Get towards the final product that is acceptable and popular and sooner
3. Core concepts
	1. Testing ideas is treated as a scientific experiment
		1. Scientific experiment
			1. Hypothesis
			2. Assumptions
			3. Test criteria
			4. Conclusion
			5. Opinion
		2. Analogy
			1. Hypothesis based off of the business idea
				1. It is idea condensed to one or two sentences
			2. Assumptions
				1. Sentences can include one or more assumptions we are testing along
	2. Example:
		1. Business selling custom T-Shirts
			1. Hypothesis: People are willing to buy custom T-shirts and they have some sort of benefit from wearing them.
				1. Assumption 1: Willing to pay for custom (custom are probably expensive)
					1. We don't know if the assumption is right unless we get out there and try
				2. Assumption 2: There's benefit from it being custom
			2. Validated Learning
				1. Information is validated from a real live experiment and not from 
					1. Market research
					2. Our inclinations or personal beliefs suggest would be
						1. We pushing out conjectures (guessing)
					3. If we try to sell it and someone says, great or we don't like this part, the information is a validated information
				2. Get as much validated learning as we can and incorporate it into the next hypothesis
			3. Pivot (significant turn)
				1. If validated learning is not at all good, we make significant change to the original idea
					1. Changing business model say
					2. Changing name
					3. Changing features
					4. ...
	3. Minimum criteria for success
		1. Before we test our hypothesis, it is always good to set a minimum criteria to judge the hypothesis or test to be true or successful
		2. It is subjective but important
		3. Example:
			1. If I show it to 10 people, I want 8 out of 10 to buy it
	4. Pitch Experiment
		1. A very useful tool to validate potential business idea
	5. **Read the boook**

### Pitch experiments ###
1. Pitch: Pitching business idea to someone
2. Experiment: The one defined by Lean Startup framework
3. Pitch Experiment: Walking up to someone (a friend say) and pitch the business idea.
	1. There is a problem with pitching to friend - biased towards saying it is a good idea (to impress you)
	2. Instead of pitching idea, we **pitch a product you pretend it's real** and pitch it to real customers in real scenarios
		1. Only in the scenario of a real potential customer who does not know you and where they are making a buying decision is when we actually figure out whether or not real customers would buy it
			1. There is not difference between pitching it to them this way for buying it than building the real product and they make a decision to buy it
	3. Example: Test a hypothesis b building a fake landing page
		1. **Pitches the product (fake at this point) as if it is real or it is soon to be real and we see how customers react**
	4. Businesses started like this. Pitched an idea and noticed that it is very popular.
		1. People signed up
		2. People gave them their emails
		3. People acted in a way that gave an idea that people had interest
	5. After they have enough information, they actually built the first version
4. How to do this? (Ther's another course - Idea Validation: From Idea to Paying Customer in One Day)
	1. Steps:
		1. Make a fake page describing what we are going to be selling or what service we are proposing
			1. Tools: Login and use a template. Type some info about what we are doing. Make a sales headline. Make some feature text. Put a fake image that makes them visualize what we are doing.
				1. Squarespace
				2. Wix.com
				3. Wordpress.com
				4. Launchrock
		2. Get people to look at it
			1. Similar to how do we find people for survey
				1. Facebook groups
				2. subreddits
				3. Industry groups
				4. Mailing lists
				5. People in the network
			2. We can send out ads (we can sign up and get coupons for free $50) - Drive traffic to our website
				1. Facebook ads
				2. Google ads
				3. Linked ads
				4. Newer platforms
5. We can use pitch experiments for everything
	1. Unless there is something too complicated
		1. A web application that promises to do certain functions but doesn't yet do it
			1. We don't have to make it real. We can say it is upcoming
				1. Give us your email address and we will email you when it happens (are they interested when it comes out?)
	2. Results: We want potential customers to
		1. Pay us money
		2. Give email address
		3. Signal some form of interest
			1. Clicking on a buy button
			2. Clicking on learn more
			3. ...
	3. If the results meet the minimum criteria, we are good to go
6. Advantages:
	1. Costs almost nothing
	2. Takes an hour or two to prepare a pitch experiment
7. MVP - Next step to validate the idea

### Constructing an MVP ###
1. A technique for validating business idea
2. Crucial to understand Lean Startup framework
3. Concept: MVP - Mininum Viable Product
	1. The absolute minimum amount of effort and resources you have to spend in order to get to a point where you can determine if a customer wants to buy your product
	2. At this point we already know they are going to buy it but show real interest.
	3. MVP can be a pitch experiment
	4. It has more functionality and more to show than a pitch experiment to convince them to buy
	5. Best MVPs have the absolute minimum (no bells and wistles)
		1. A pitch experiment or
		2. First product
4. Example:
	1. Restaurant
		1. MVP - Street car or food truck (not a full-fledged restaurant), a brochure that has menu (to see how many dial in to buy the order)
			1. One item from the menu and take it to a food event or park to see if people would buy it
		2. It costs a fraction as compared to persuing a full restaurant
		3. We just want to see if people are interested in the idea and are ready to pay
	2. Shoes
		1. Zappos
			1. Basic website
			2. Took stores and took photos
			3. They put on website
			4. When cutomers requested, they went to the stores, bought them and shipped them
5. MVP - very basic prototype or first version of what we want to sell
	1. Mobile App
		1. Pick the one feature that can be the most popular or deliver the most value to potential customers
		2. Build it
			1. To save money further
				1. Simulate it (instead of coding it)
					1. It may not even look good
						1. Why would anyone buy something that doesn't look good?
							1. In business there are two kinds of customers
								1. Someone who really want to buy it
									1. Don't care how MVP looks (these people will just pay you and we can re-invest the money to go from here)
									2. If people won't pay for your basic version, the ideas is not good (noone desires it)
								2. Someone who kind of want to buy it
									1. They want it polished
	2. Example:
		1. Website
			1. Use squarespace or Wix and use a template
			2. Drupal or Wordpress - CMS
		2. Online Store
			1. Shopify.com
				1. Store in 10-15 minutes
					1. Fake products
		3. Custom application
			1. Try outsourcing
			2. Take the minimum version we can and hire someone else who is cheap and make a decent job at it
	3. If noone comes forward to buy it, we have saved resources and time

### Section 6 review material ###
### Quiz 5: Validating your ideas ###

## Section 7: Fundraising ##
### Know your options ###
1. Once we have a business idea, how do we get the resources you need?
	1. Options: Major ones
		1. Only one of the funding sources has to work
			1. See what fits you best
		2. Some of the funding sources are tried and true, but some are brand new

### Bootstrapping ###
1. Concept - hear over and over
	1. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps
		1. Pick yourself up on your own without anyone's help
	2. Bootstrapping - do it yourself (fund it yourself)
		1. We did everything we need to get to a point where you make money or you don't need investment anymore
		2. Most businesses get bootstrapped up to a certain point
			1. It is very hard to raise money on just an idea unless we know really rich people who owe us a favor
		3. How far can you go with bootstrapping?
			1. If less money, we can go pretty far and switch into another fundraising techniqe
		4. How do Entrepreneurs bootstrap and what techniques they use?
			1. Things to consider
				1. Minimize cost as must as possible (don't risk your own money)
				2. Can grow a little slower because we end up cutting corners (by focussing on price over quality)
			2. Know what resources are available
			3. Follow MVP approach
		5. Fake it till you make it
			1. Focus on simulating as much as we can and spend on and resources on products when they are absolutely needed
			2. Present it as if we have already done it (but we have not actually done it)
				1. Selling product even without making it
		6. Focus on efficieny
			1. How much we spend vs how far it gets you
			2. How do we save our bank account
		7. Creativity
			1. We can boostrap in very creative ways
2. How to bootstrap your business
	1. Find co-founders or partners
		1. With own money we may not be able to get to a point where business is running on its own
		2. If we pool money with co-founders or multiple partners we might be able to get to a point where we make money or take investments
		3. They usually have skillsets
			1. The most skillsets you have in your group, the less you have to pay for
				1. If someone knows marketing and promotion, we can save money on the marketing we do
			2. If partner is a developer, we can save money on actual development
	2. Re-work your idea or business model so that it makes money sooner
		1. If we have limited resources, we must be realistic about our situation
			1. We need revenue sooner because we need to revenue to build out the product further
				1. Figure out what part of the product is the most valuable & what part of it we can charge for
					1. Isolate that and build it first (to make money first and use the revenue to re-invest)
		2. Example: Video production company
			1. Make videos, edit, make graphics, actors, pick up locations, ... for people who want to make videos
				1. Bootstrapping it is a lot of money
					1. Then we only buy cameras & focus on editing and graphics
					2. Make money
					3. Expand into the other sections
	3. Do it yourself (DIY)
		1. Very important
			1. Entrepreneur does anything an everything they can during startup phase
				1. In the beginning, we cannot hire people to make everything we need
			2. Focus on what we can do
				1. Build an application and bootstrap it
				2. Learn how to build an application enough to get to a proficiency to get to the first version
			3. I am cheap labour in my company and have infinite time (theoretically)
			4. Do something to get to the point where it is running and working
		2. Benefits
			1. Learning about different aspects of our business
				1. Makes me a better Entrepreneur
				2. We can have a better understanding of what we are doing and why it might work and what's not going to work
				3. Hard to be a successful entrepreneur if we understand only one section of a business
			2. Example:
				1. Amazon: They want every employee to work as a customer service agent for 2 hours
					1. Makes employees understand one side of the business they have no exposure to
						1. Better to come up with product ideas if we know what people complained about
	4. Focus on key metrics
		1. If we are bootstrapping it, we have only so many resources
		2. If we know that we are taking it to the investments, **focus on the things the future investors will look for**
			1. Spend money on things that matter (for higher numbers)
				1. Customers
				2. Margins
				3. How large market is and why we have evidence that it is so big
			2. Smart inverstors care more about the numbers than how polished or how well put together your product or service is
				1. If you say I can make it at $10 and sell it for $200 over and over here, and I spend $0 on marketing.
					1. Probably enough for investment without checking much
		3. Eventually, we run out of cash, and we can switch to other fundraising techniques and we have the numbers to get us there
	5. Focus on gorilla marketing (duct tape marketing)
		1. Marketing that is very cheap and focuses on ROI
			1. We generally do things that are very cheap or cost almost nothing and get buzz (people speak about it)
				1. We do something in a **novel** way and reach out to one person, they will spread it, and the propagation continues
					1. It spreads itself since it is novel
						1. Example: Cheap and funny ads
	6. Sell your equity for actual services
		1. If we are pursuing something that has the potential to make a lot of money down the line (or a modest amount of money),
			1. We can sell a piece of the future
			2. **Equity - invisible money that an Entrepreneur can use to leverage other people to work at the beginning stage**
				1. Take some risk with me and save me this money.
				2. If it doesn't work, you will have an outsized gain in the future
	7. Fill up your credit cards
		1. In the beginning stages
3. Bootstrapping summary - Get as far as you can with as little as you can.
	1. If we go all the way to the revenue - best 
	2. If we don't go all the way, focus on key metrics

### FFF & Angels ###
1. Bootstrapping - smallest source of funding (with personal savings)
2. FFF - Friends, Family, and Fools (anyone dumb enough to invest in you)
	1. Friends, family
		1. Investment is low
		2. Not savvy enough to know if your business idea is good or will succeed
		3. Small loans from friends and family
			1. To get to a point where we get to the next funding source - Angels
		4. Easier to get the money, but comes with strings attached (relationship)
			1. If the business doesn't succeed and wastes their money, it could potentially ruin the relationship (cannot run away from relationships)
3. Angels:
	1. Rich individuals, or high networth individuals who frequently invest in small businesses and startups
	2. They typically help you out
		1. They invest at a stage where we need more capital than what we get from friends and family, but do not qualify for a bank loan, or have a lot of revenue, or any at all
	3. They are often champions of my company & usually well-known in the community
	4. Range: $20k to $200k
		1. More than FFF
		2. Lot less than what we get from VCs
	5. Benefit - We can string them together to make larger amounts of money if we need
	6. Hard to find
	7. Angels typically know each other and have a pretty well-defined affiliations
		1. If we meet one angel, they are likely to know 10-20 other angels
	8. How do angels operate?
		1. They usually have their own investment criteria
			1. So they can vary widely
				1. If one says no, there are others who might fund you
	9. They usually have a lower barrier to receiving investments (vs Loan, VCs)
		1. Reasons:
			1. They are investing their own money (they do it if they feel like doing it)
				1. Usually in small chunks
				2. No approval by fund or board is required
	10. They invest in areas they have expertise in
		1. They are more confident and are likely to invest
			1. Unlike VCs who invest in anything
				1. They usually don't know anything about your industry (not confident so harder to get money from them)
	11. Why do they invest?
		1. They want to make money
			1. They are not concerned about multiples (2x, 10x, ...)
				1. They just think about upside (% increase) and they don't have strict requirements about how big the company could be 
		2. It aids a business they already have
			1. It helps them greeze the agreement
			2. Helps in networking, recruiting in some way that makes their existing business more successful
		3. Excitement and prestige
			1. It is boring to invest in mutual funds, stocks, ETF - doesn't do anything
			2. It is exciting because it could potentially be a big business and also has a likelyhood of failure
			3. Prestige:
				1. They can say they are investors
				2. It's like a badge to show to other people
					1. I invested this much and it has grown so much etc. (if you have heard of them, I am a prestigious investor)
	12. Famous Angel Investors
		1. Chris Sacca - Lowercase capital
			1. Twitter
			2. Uber
	13. Angels invest to make them sound great and bigger than they really are
4. Finding Angels
	1. Connect with successful people in your industry
		1. They don't have to be investors but are successful
		2. Example: Video games
			1. Look for video games similar to what we are trying to build
				1. If there are people who sold their company or someone accessible, try to meet them
					1. **Say you're looking for mentorship**
					2. **Say you're looking for someone to bounce ideas off of**
		3. Approach them from the angel of:
			1. I need mentorship
			2. I need someone to talk with businesses
			3. I need a business deal
			4. ...
		4. Wrong approach
			1. I am looking for money - harder to get them trust you and like your business
	2. Make a list of relevant people in the industry we are going into (even if it is a sub industry)
		1. **LinkedIn - People who list themselves as an "investor"**
			1. Probably invests a lot and is likely to invest in a similar business
	3. **AngelList, Wefunding, Gusto, FundersClub** (Sites)
		1. Invaluable
		2. Social networks for startups and small businesses to find angel investors and VCs
		3. Angels spend a lot of time in them looking for startups that they find interesting
			1. If we spend a lot of time making our page look good and look attractive, it can get a lot of attention from angel investors
	4. Angel groups and sindicates
		1. Angels don't want to spend a lot of time doing due diligence and research on the firm or market so they band together and have one person do the research and everyone makes a decision as a group and invest as a group
		2. They are easier to contact than individual angels
			1. Notable angel groups and sindicates - resources section
				1. If we go through the groups and apply through their traditional channels and websites, it is a great first step
	5. Go after angels who invest frequently
		1. They have a lower barrier for investment
		2. Less frequent investors spend a lot more time thinking about it and are much more risk averse
2. It is a snowball system
	1. We could spend 6 months finding one angel but find 20 angels the next month
		1. Once we figure out something that works, it works really well

### Equity & Debt ###
1. What is equity?
	1. Ownership
	2. Why startups refer to ownerships as equity?
		1. To receive investment
		2. To recruit new people to join their business
		3. Why?
			1. Startups are very ambitious and are shooting for a large outcome
				1. The value of the ownership if it gets big and gets a lot of money, that's enough to get investments and recruit people
	3. Startups measure themselves in terms of stock
		1. Each business owns a certain amount of stock
			1. If you own certain stocks, that's your business share
		2. Stock: It is an easy way to keep track of who owns what
			1. Can refer to different parts of the business
			2. Can refer to different amounts
			3. Different rules are assigned based on different stocks
	4. How much does one own? a few out of the total amount of stocks
	5. Example:
		1. I sold 30% of my equity to an investor
		2. Suppose we make $100 next year
		3. The investor gets $30
	6. Starups
		1. When can you make money out of equity?
			1. If someone buys our shares
			2. If the business gets sold to a larger company
			3. If the business goes public and we can sell it on the public market
	7. Small businesses
		1. $100 profit gives $30 to the investor
2. Dividends
	1. Suppose company has excess profit so they reward the people who invested in a company by sharing some of it
		1. We passed down dividends based on how much they own
	2. The ways to sell equity are called exits
		1. Equity doesn't have value but when you exit, you get the value of it
			1. Exiting
				1. Selling company
				2. Selling shares
				3. Company doing an IPO
					1. Sell it on Wallstreet
		2. When we convert equity into cash, it is called exit
3. Debt
	1. Amount loaned to me that I have to pay back
		1. With equity, we don't have to pay it back but want to share the proportion to the investor when he exits
	2. Paid back based on the terms agreed to
	3. Through APR and APY - Interest percentage
	4. This is more dangerous than equity
		1. If company doesn't do well and doesn't make money, we don't own anything to the investor
	5. Debt needs to be repaid whether the company succeeds or fails
	6. Sources
		1. Small business loan
		2. Friends and family that loaned them money
	7. How to get it?
		1. If we have an established revenue and a decent history of it
		2. If we have physical assets
			1. Buy car, house, etc. for the company and they are mortaged
4. How inverstors work?
	1. Termsheets
5. How do business loans work?

### Loans ###
1. Loans - A form of debt
	1. Loans come from banks and credit unions
	2. Loans range between $10k to $300k
		1. For more it belongs to a different category
	3. Banks gather money from savings and checking account deposits, etc.
	4. Banks make money by investing in businesses
	5. We go to a bank and ask for a loan, and if we meet their requirement, they will approve your loan
		1. They have a criteria list
	6. Pros
		1. Loaned money is some of the cheapest money you can get (business loan)
			1. 6% APR
				1. If business becomes successful, 6% is nothing
			2. It is a decent option (as compared to equity) if company would become very successful
		2. Loans can give you a wide range of money
			1. They give what we ask for
	7. Cons
		1. Loans have a higher bar to quality (than any other investment structure)
			1. We need already existing cash flow OR
				1. We are already making some form of money (doesn't have to be profit but we are taking in money)
					1. Capable to pay back (we have more money to work with)
			2. We need assets
				1. In the worst case scenario, they can sieze those and that's how they can get their money back
			3. They only care about minimizing the risk
				1. They don't care about upside or how much they make in a positive scenario
		2. If you default on your loan, that can affect you personally
			1. Can destroy credit
			2. Can lead to bankruptcy
		3. Banks will not invest in you unless they have 2 years of records of history
			1. Exceptions: Pre-existing relationships might result in dropping to a year
	8. There's a time a place for them
		1. They are good option if we are already there
			1. Otherwise go to other options
	9. Bank loans make sense whe nyou need "expansion capital"
		1. Expansion capital: You need money to grow your business
			1. You may have x amount of orders to fill but you don't have money to fill them and you need the cash
	10. Start a relationship with the bank early on
		1. Establish a history much before starting a business
			1. Much more likely to forgo the criteria for investment
	11. Try small banks and credit unions
		1. Smaller decision structures + few decision makers
	12. Don't try to sell them on the upside
		1. They just care about the risk of losing their investment is low
2. Other Options:
	1. Peer to peer lending - lending trade
	2. More progressive companies - they usually make a decision instantly. They use a different criteria. Less stringent (terms are different so look at them)
		1. Cabbage
		2. Swift capital

### Venture capital ###
1. What's VC?
	1. There are professional institutes and organizations that for a living invest in startups
		1. Large startups & larger companies come into contact with VCs
			1. Sequoia - VC firm
				1. Hold a large portion of Google
				2. Professional firm that staffs
					1. Venture Capitalists
					2. Analysts
					3. Associates
				3. They look for deals
				4. They actively negotiate for startup deals and try to invest in them 
2. When can you go after VC?
	1. When we have a startup or an ambitious idea and we need a lot of money
		1. Lifestyle businesses look for Angel investors long before VCs
	2. Good if shooting for the moon and need millions of dollars to do something
		1. Otherwise think of other options
3. How does VC work?
	1. People don't invest their own money 
	2. They operate a fund of other people's money
	3. They know rich people and take money from them and invest the fund into promising startups
	4. The fund lasts for 7 years
		1. At the end of 7 year period they will return money to limited partner (investor into VC fund)
	5. They are profesionals 
		1. They must make money in 7 years
	6. Access to VC depends on Geography and network
	7. Where to find?
		1. Cities with
			1. Rich people AND
			2. High tier exclusive universities
		2. Why?
			1. Two ingredients for startups
				1. High-tier univs - smart motivated people
				2. Right people - to give money
		3. Larger cities have VC firms
			1. They like to be where the deals are
		4. 90% of the VC money are spent in Silicon Valley
			1. Area between San Jose and San Francisco
	8. It's harder to get attention in a small city
		1. Solution:
			1. Hot to get funded
				1. Get a referral
					1. 400 pitches a week - hard to get attention
						1. Solution: Judge on who they are getting referrals from (if they know it is better)
							1. Don't try to contact them directly
							2. Any referral is better than no referral
				2. Where do you get referrals?
					1. Ask around - If we have friends who have business or owns their own business, ask groups we are part of
						1. Go to your friends who have businesses
							1. If they are successful, they might have come across VCs, and they don't mind referring to them.
					2. Angel inverstors often have connections to larger VCs
						1. A lot of them work in tandem with them
			3. Understand where VC firms operate
				1. VCs are professionals at finding deals
					1. They usually troll through lists like (small businesses looking for funding post their pitches and product videos, and team-member information, and present themselves to public - they get contacted by investors)
						1. Angellist.co
						2. Gusto.com
				2. Go to
					1. Hackathons
					2. Meetups
					3. Events
					4. Pitch & business plan competitions (great way of getting their attention)
				3. Incubators - next lecture (fantastic way)
			4. Make sure you're in the right position to do this
				1. Idea is fully conceptualized
				2. We have real stats and information to support your claims 
				3. Go to them if you actually have revenue and an established business
			5. Odds of having positive interactions and receiving investments come down to how well developed I am
				1. The more we have done, the more attractive we are
				2. Just an idea doesn't attract them
4. VCs are the way to get most money
5. They are biggest risk with regards to receiving investment
	1. They trade money for equity (ownership)
		1. The more money you ask, the % equity might have to be given (40% - 50%)
6. They don't have second thoughts about getting rid of founders or making significant changes to companies after they have bought it
7. 90% of VC funds do not make money
	1. 9/10 investments fail
		1. The one that is succesful must pay for the other 9 that failed
			1. The only invest in companies that have the potential to pay off the other 9
				1. A company that has 90% chance of doubling a VC money is worth less (it pays only two failed investments) than a company that has a 10% chance of going 20x (pays for all 10 investments) on their money
8. How to pitch to VCs
	1. Try to make it larger than it is
	2. Describe the market and describe what we do has a lot of runway, a lot of possibility, and a lot of market behind it

### Incubators ###

			1. However, there's a list of things to be done that are consistent in all of them.
				1. Who owns the company? 
					1. Very important for investors. They need to understand the ownership who are the decision makers. Who's the boss
				2. What do you do?
					1. People usually don't know what I do. They need a quick summary of what it is. It can't be figured out from the website always.

### WORKSHEET: Idea Lister Builder ###
### Section 8 review material ###

## Section 9: Laying the groundwork ##
### The idea equation ###
1. Every business idea consists of different components
	1. If we have only one or two components, we do not have a complete business idea
		1. Example: Ideas that would be acceptable to pitch to someone else, or pitch to investors, or teammate
			1. Complete idea:
				1. People who rent out vacational rentals of their space or people who use services like Phi RBO, AirBnb, they have a problem of buying commonly used items by guests (used at higher frequency like linens & towels, toilet papers, dishwashers). It would be hard for owners to constantly re-buying the stuff, especially when they are renting them out constantly. I am going to make a subscription service that they can sign up for that will automatically replenishes through a mail the items they constantly buy (supplies)
					1. Components:
						1. Vacation rental owners have trouble buying rental supplies, like linens & towels.
						2. This problem would be solved with a subscription service business that automatically replenishes these supplies.
			2. Incomplete idea
				1. Vacation rental owners rely too much on one or two platforms for bookings (finding customers is hard)
					1. Only the problem is stated
	2. Ideas can be broken down into individual components
	3. Ideas evolve over time
		1. Most ideas start as incomplete ideas
			1. We dwell on it 
			2. We add in observations
			3. We notice something else and add it in 
			4. They add more details
			5. Eventually come with a complete idea
2. Breakdown:
	1. Subject - Who in your idea is benefitting from the proposed idea, service, or product
		1. Who?
			1. An individual person
			2. A set of potential customers that share something in common
			3. A business
			4. An industry in general (much broader)
		2. It helps if ideas are as detailed as possible.
			1. It is still helpful to say, this is the group of people I am targeting with this idea
				1. Idea is not complete if we don't know who we are exactly targeting.
					1. Drill down to a specific group of people
						1. Don't keep the target subject as everyone.
							1. Pick a specific group
								1. We can have multiple groups (we don't know for which group the idea is appealing)
	2. Problem/Benefit
		1. A problem or a benefit
			1. What's a problem? (A reductive)
				1. It is something they are struggling with
					1. **They want to do this, but this is preventing them**
					2. **They want to spend more time on this, but they spend too much time on this**
				2. Identify a **pain point**
					1. Pain point: A specific issue that a potential customer has, and we need to address
			2. What is a benefit?
				1. An idea that will benefit that group (ad additive)
				2. **I have found some technology or service or some value I can add, but doesn't essentially cover up a problem, but it is something they would pay to use, something they would enjoy, and it would benefit them in some way**
		2. 90% of business ideas are problem-based
			1. **I personally have this problem, and I personally came up with a solution to solve the problem. Now I am going to apply that to everyone**
			2. Example:
				1. Employees in midsize companies want to communicate with rich media, like images. Currently they cannot, and [it is frustrating that] they have to use x, y, z workaround in order to.
					1. Painpoint: It is frustrating
						1. They cannot share images directly
						2. It is more frustrating if it is essential
		3. Benefits-based ideas are not common but there are good examples of them
			1. Example: By supplying all employees in mid-size companies with bluetooth headsets, they could communicate at 3x their normal rate
				1. A technology that will make them better at what they do, but it may not cover up a problem
					1. We never established that they had a problem communicating
					2. We have also not established that speed was a problem within their communication
			2. Benefit based businesses are harder to identify
	3. Business model
		1. How we specifically address the problem. How we would specifically distribute the value of our services. How we would get our service/product to the customer.
		2. Example:
			1. E-books
				1. Business models:
					1. Ala-Karte purchasing - we see a book, we add it to the cart and we purchase them, they pay you x amount, and they consume it.
					2. Membership - They pay x amount per month for a membership, and consume x amount of books per month.
				2. The above two are exact same businesses with two business models
		3. A business model is testable and can be changed in the future
		4. Tips:
			1. When we have a subject and a problem/benefit, start with the business model that we think is the most appropriate.
			2. Have a couple of business models in mind
				1. If the first one doesn't work out, we can test the others
		5. Apropriateness of a business model to an idea is a big deal
			1. Example: e-book
				1. Inapproriate - Pay what you want model
					1. Offer a good and tell the person to pay whatever they want (it works like a library)

### Areas to isolate & target ###
1. Where do business ideas apply and where can I target my business ideas towards
	1. To analyze a market and come up with potential ideas
2. Subject - doesn't say what section of industry they exist in
3. Business always tries to either:
	1. Make something better OR
	2. Allow someone to do something new
4. Where to apply business ideas towards?
	1. To customer purchasing something OR
	2. To a suppliar or large business
5. How do we know if we are missing any potential customer groups

#### 4 Areas of Innovation ####
1. Procurement
2. Product (or Service)
	1. Product: It has to be obtained somewhere or put together somewhere 
	2. Service: Staffed by someone that was procured from somewhere
3. Delivery
	1. Mechanism used for the product or service
4. Promotion

#### Details ####
1. The four areas we can target, breakdown, innovate, and define a successful business in

#### Product/Service ####
1. Product (or service): Whatever we are selling to an end customer
	1. Example: Individual pizza sold to a customer
	2. Example: Individual tax advice (service) is the product the customer got
2. Each product has several characteristics and traits about it which makes it unique

#### Procurement ####
1. Thinking about where your product or service came from
	1. For physical products:
		1. What went into the product, where did it come from?
		2. How did the company obtain the items that went into the product
2. If we think in terms of service:
	1. Where did the person who deliver the service come from?
	2. How did the business find them?
	3. How did the business vet them?
	4. How did the business train them?
3. Everything leading to the point that they deliver the product to you
4. Procurement: **Everything that happens before the productization of the service/product**
	1. Example:
		1. Pizza
			1. Where did they get their ingredients?
			2. Who delivered them?
	2. How the product was assembled (or how the product is made) doesn't go into the procurement
		1. It is the unique identity of the product
			1. It can be assembled in any way (which is not part of the procurement)
#### Targets ####
1. New Entrepreneurs try to target one of the two
	1. They look at companies and say: 
		1. Example: They sell this, and I can supply it to them cheaper.
		2. Example: I can come up with a business idea that directly targets the way the business procured their product
2. New Entrepreneurs focus way too much on product
	1. They try to make a better product vs what's already existing
3. New Entrepreneurs also look at it as a problem/solution set
	1. This problem is met by this product OR
	2. I can solve the problem in a better way
4. There are two other spaces we can target our innovation towards
	1. **Delivery**
		1. Example: Pizza
			1. The pizza gets to the customer in some way
				1. **The way that the product or value or service is delivered to the customer is a delivery mechanism**
					1. Example: Mail
					2. Example: Put at the front of the store and it is picked up
					3. Example: Phone for tax advice
					4. Example: Skype for tax advice
					5. Example: Online for tax advice - customer bought the service and the meeting was set up online
					6. Example: Mail for packet of tax advice
	2. **Promotion**
		1. It is the advertising channels
			1. It is the way the individual service or product company decided to promote their item
			2. It is a function of what media outlets they decided to put ads on
				1. Internet
				2. Television
				3. Radio
				4. Newspapers
				5. Magazines
			3. It is a fucntion of where they decided to run their targeted campaigns
			4. It is a function of referral programs
5. **Pick which area you want to apply your innovation** (When thinking about industry we want to get into, or problem we want to solve, try to look at it as 4 different quadrants - Pick an area you want to apply innovation towards)
	1. Product/Service
	2. Procurement
	3. Delivery
	4. Promotion
		1. Decide one area and how we can improve it
6. Examples: Pizza
	1. Product/Service
		1. Starting our own Pizza store / making a better pizza
	2. Procurement
		1. Make tooks that target Pizaa businesses
	3. Delivery
		1. Build a drone that delivers Pizza faster
		2. An app that drivers put into their cars for drivers to coordinate
		3. An app for users to see where the pizza is in real-time
	4. Promotion
		1. Design a referral-based system that they put inside pizza boxes that allows them to share it with their friends
7. Tip: **Try to look at every single quadrant for an opportunity**

### 5 types of innovation ###
1. So far:
	1. What goes into making a business idea
	2. What areas in the value-chain that we can apply a business idea or a type of innovation towards
2. 5 types of innovation - for new business or tackling a new market (there are many actually - 30)
	1. Business ideas are trying to improve things or add benefits
3. How can you improve? (market, service, product, ...)
	1. Price - People like lower prices
		1. If we can solve a problem for lower price, we have a business opportunity
		2. How to lower price?
			1. Process innovation: 
				1. We might know a better way of sourcing the material for our product, OR
				2. We might know a way to reduce costs that are incidental
					1. Transportation
					2. Advertising
					3. ...
		3. Another dimension to price
			1. Same product, lower price
				1. There are people who sold the same product, but with higher price
					1. Reason? It increases the perception of quality
					2. Which markets does it happen?
						1. Fashion
						2. Education
					3. When does raising the price work?
						1. When the market obscures what the actual value of the product we are delivering (Education - We pay before getting the education, and there is no refund policy)
						2. Markets where average price charged for the product is low, and people secretly or not secretly are willing to pay more for it
				2. Startups:
					1. They are taking old stale industries and service businesses, they are upping the price, and adding a little bit more to the product offer.
						1. Example: Laundromat - improvement: It is picked up for you, they get hand-cleaned, and folded, and delivered.
				3. Example:
					1. Market or good or product sold is commoditized and quality between the products is indistinguishable.
						1. Example: Fashion
							1. Same set of companies roughly selling the same things
								1. Upper bound and lower bound for the quality of the product is not very big
									1. There is scope for raising the price
										1. Example: School that has higher fee is perceived to be giving a better education
											1. **Higher price increases the percieved value**
												1. Higher price T-Shirts makes you think something is good about the T-Shirts.
			2. Airline industry
				1. They have figured out that the price is the only thing people care about
					1. Cheap airlines with bare minimum service are becoming popular
	2. Convenience
		1. **It is the ease at which a customer can purchase the product or service from you.**
			1. Could apply to effort needed to buy the product or service.
			2. Could apply to difference in time between when they purchase it and when it is delivered. 
		2. Focuses on friction
			1. What is friction?
				1. Every single step or action required by the customer to do something
					1. **If we remove steps, and remove customer actions, we are lowering friction**
						1. Example:
							1. Asking customer, fname, lname, phone, email, ... and sign on the dot
								1. Alternative: fname, lname
			2. Example: Hailing a cab
				1. Walk outside and find a cab
				2. Call a company and say pick me up now
					1. Wait for them, find them, get in the car, they take you wherever
					2. Paid by cash
				3. On-Demand economy - Uber, Lyft, Postmates, Shyp
					1. They add convenience
						1. Take out app
							1. Put a pin
							2. Press a button
							3. Person picks you up and take you
							4. It is cashless
